Using qualitative in-depth interviews collected in the Dutch municipality of Tilburg in 2018–2019, we examine the arguments underlying popular opinions about a UBI and work conditionality. The analysis suggests that these arguments can be interpreted from two theoretical perspectives. On the one hand, respondents make frequent use of deservingness criteria referring to the characteristics of welfare recipients, such as their need and work willingness. On the other hand, they justify their opinions using arguments related to the characteristics of welfare schemes, such as their administrative and financial feasibility. Our findings offer important insights concerning political actors who support (or oppose) the real-world implementation of a UBI.",https://doi.org/10.1017/ics.2020.15,An unconditional basic income?

-33.369118,11.436108,2,"Abstract Does a penny per month constitute a Basic Income? Were that penny to be paid individually, universally, and unconditionally, the answer would be ‘yes’, following the definition of Basic Income given by some of its leading advocates, be it organisations like the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) or prominent scholars such as Philippe Van Parijs. Some might be puzzled as to how this could be ‘a capitalist road to communism’, or give us ‘freedom as the power to say no’, both of which have been advocated by prominent researchers. The purpose of this paper is not to argue for or against their definition, but rather to situate it historiographically, enabling fruitful discussion. The paper will show how there was a widely shared assumption in the 1970s and 80s, at the early stages of both academic articulations and public discussion, that Basic Income comes with some notion of a threshold or level to be taken as a minimum or as adequate. The paper goes on to outline three issues that arise once the concept of a threshold is dropped from the definition. Examined in addition are five justifications for doing so. Much like any other idea, the concept of Basic Income is a social construct. By situating it here within a historical perspective, we wish to facilitate academic discussion regarding both the achievements and erasures that have occurred as a consequence of the concept’s academic refinement—refinement that is in itself majorly indebted to BIEN and Van Parijs.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0037,Is a Penny a Month a Basic Income?

This article argues that these concepts do not imply a solid case against unconditional transfers.

44.020363,5.4209847,4,"Recent debates about inequality have focused almost exclusively on the distribution of wealth and disparities in income, but little notice has been paid to the distribution of free time. Free time is commonly assumed to be a matter of personal preference, a good that one chooses to have more or less of. Even if there is unequal access to free time, the cause and solution are presumed to lie with the resources of income and wealth. This book argues that these views are fundamentally mistaken. First, it contends that free time is a resource, like money, that one needs in order to pursue chosen ends. Further, realizing a just distribution of income and wealth is not sufficient to ensure a fair distribution of free time. Because of this, anyone concerned with distributive justice must attend to the distribution of free time. On the basis of widely held liberal principles, the book explains why citizens are entitled to free time—time not committed to meeting life's necessities and instead available for chosen pursuits. The novel argument that the just society must guarantee all citizens their fair share of free time provides principled grounds to address critical policy choices, including work hours regulations, Sunday closing laws, public support for caregiving, and the pursuit of economic growth. The book demonstrates why all citizens have, in the words of early labor reformers, a right to “hours for what we will.”",https://doi.org/10.23943/princeton/9780691163451.001.0001,Free Time

From the narratives of de Quevedo’s El Buscón , in which beggars are presented as able-bodied individuals making a concerted effort to take advantage of others, to the invasive physical tests and “workhouses” that were part of the English Poor Laws, the poor have long been regarded as deserving careful oversight. Although in increasingly subtle ways, this history continues as part of a popular set of policies in Latin America called “Conditional Cash Transfers,” which make income support conditional on certain behavioral changes. This paper argues that this resumption in recent times is normatively problematic because it harms the beneficiaries’ self-esteem, leading to stereotypes and sociological errors that reproduce social hierarchies.

-7.5534325,26.243908,2,"In December 2010, Iran launched a five-year program to reform its system of price subsidies. In the first of several stages, subsidies were partially cut by raising prices of fuel products and some other goods and services, in most cases, several-fold. The net proceeds were partly earmarked to finance a compensatory cash transfer program that pays every Iranian residing in the country the equivalent of $40–45 a month, unconditionally. The later stages of the reform will see further rises in prices and transfer payments in tandem until subsidies are entirely eliminated. This, in a nutshell, is the “Iran model” of basic income. It differs in some respects from the common conceptions of basic income in the literature and may therefore be more accurately termed a “de facto basic income.” The story of how this de facto basic income came into being and some of its early results are recounted elsewhere.1 This chapter focuses on the model itself, elaborating on its key features, its genesis, the challenges it faces, and some of its lessons.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137031655_2,From Price Subsidies to Basic Income: The Iran Model and Its Lessons
-3.452632,41.362865,4,"At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have struggled to address both the healthcare crisis and rapidly devolving economic conditions. These events have pushed governments to consider large economic relief programs. In the United States, congress approved an over $2 trillion relief package to combat the devastating economic decline. However, most families spent their one-time cash payment on rent and food during the month it was provided. This left many to face uncertain futures as their ability to earn an income diminished and the promise of additional relief waned. Universal basic income (UBI) is one program which provides a regular disbursement to individuals without means testing or other action on the part of recipient (Van Parijs, 2013). The program is one potential tool for combating recession, mass unemployment, and wide-spread business closures. Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article discusses the use of UBI to meet these challenging circumstances. Given the depth of the economic issues, UBI may be suited to address these challenges as opposed to, or in conjunction with, other relief measures. Discussion is focused on how UBI may serve as a public policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications. A UBI program consists of payments disbursed by the government to citizens to provide a baseline of income in order to alleviate poverty, spur economic growth, generate entrepreneurial activity, and replace jobs lost due to technological innovation (BIEN, 2020; D'Mello, 2019). UBI programs should meet three criteria as follows: (1) distributed to individuals, (2) not means tested, and (3) no attached requirements to receiving the payment (e.g., seeking employment or attending school; Van Parijs, 2013). Two additional considerations for programs are regular intervals for payments and the freedom to choose how the money may be used (BIEN, 2020). Several nations have previously considered UBI including Brazil, Canada, Finland, India, Kenya, and Switzerland (BIEN, 2020; D'Mello, 2019). Alaska, a conservative-leaning state, has the longest standing UBI supplemented by oil revenue since the 1980s. This program has reduced the rate of poverty among indigenous people with particularly notable progress for children and the elderly (Hanna & Olken, 2018). Some oil rich nations in the Middle East have similar programs (Van Parijs, 2013). UBI is often associated with alleviating mass poverty or financial hardship (e.g., mass unemployment) as it tends to be more beneficial for the most vulnerable in the population as opposed to the middle or upper classes (Lowrey, 2018). However, even in wealthy nations, such as the United States, a major illness or the loss of a job may lead to financial collapse for many middle-class families. As such, an argument exists for even wealthy nations to implement a UBI. First identified in China in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a health crisis and financial difficulty for millions of people. As of 17 July 2020, 14 million cases worldwide (3.6 million United States) have tested positive for infection (Johns Hopkins, 2020). Evidence from Italy, Spain, South Korea, China, and the United States show that large number of patients can overwhelm healthcare resources (Johns Hopkins, 2020). Thus, large scale “lock-downs” and other measures have been implemented to curb the progression of the virus. The economic fallout has led to mass unemployment and historic drops in economic activity (OECD, 2020). Nations are confronting the economic situation by implementing various expensive relief programs. The persistence of the pandemic alongside the economic downturn presents several unique challenges compared with past recessions. First, the need to shutter many businesses led to millions of jobless in a matter of days/weeks. Unlike the 2007–2009 recession, multiple industries were affected immediately, as opposed to a more gradual decline. Second, even for those remaining employed, uncertainty and “lock-down” measures left many consumers spending less money, focusing on building their savings. The decrease in consumer spending is particularly difficult for nations with economies that are heavily bolstered by service industries. Lastly, due to the potential virus to spread, virtually all businesses will need to take steps to increase safety by reducing physical contact. Healthcare facilities, higher education, entertainment venues, restaurants, office spaces, retail stores, etc. with a physical location may be forced to limit the number of employees and customers on a given premises. Without safety precautions in place, many people may fear visiting businesses even as “lock-down” restrictions are relaxed. As such, economic deterioration could remain for extended period as medical research seeks to provide treatments and vaccines. As the pandemic persists and the economic downturn effects are projected to be long lasting, supply and demand have been disrupted (OECD, 2020). A growing list of companies have declared bankruptcy since the onset of the pandemic. As these companies fold, there will be fewer employers/jobs available when the economy begins recovery. The challenges of incorporating social distancing may steer employers towards greater reliance on automation and technology. Similarly, employee health issues may threaten supply chains. While a costly capital investment for companies, automated processes provide a safer and more reliable means to accomplish basic tasks. For example, supply lines would be less vulnerable with no truck-drivers to become ill or need rest, and driverless taxi services would pose fewer risks to passengers. There are many types of relief programs that provide benefits directly to individuals. Table 1 provides a comparison across programs on qualification characteristics and the time expectation for financial impact expectancy. Actual implementation of specific programs vary depending on government action. As large numbers of people turn to government supplements in the face of mass layoffs, there are several aid options available. UBI is one type of the economic relief program. Guaranteed basic income (GBI) programs include disbursements but are means tested (Van Parijs, 2013). In response to the pandemic, Spain implemented a GBI program to assist its poorest residents but not others (e.g., the lower-middle class) who may still have financial difficulties (Pinedo & Landauro, 2020). Programs allowing for a refund beyond the amount paid in income taxes, such as Negative Income Tax or Earned Income Tax Credits, are targeted at lower classes. These programs may prove beneficial for a small portion of the population but tend to have a lag in the economic relief they provide (Burtless & Hausman, 1978), and typically benefit those with an income not the mass number of unemployed. Short-term or one-time cash payments provide immediate funds to people but fail to bolster long-term confidence in the economy. In March 2020, the United States approved a means-tested, one-time cash payment to eligible taxpayers; however, these funds did not provide a lasting benefit as several million in the United States still were forced to also draw unemployment benefits (OECD, 2020). Governments may also implement plans targeted at specific needs such as nutritional programs. The downside of this solution is the limitation on funds to assist with other types of expenses or needs. A UBI provides a base level of financial security over the long-term as it decreases uncertainty and are guaranteed without conditions. Unlike most safety nets, including cash payments, UBIs are not means tested but rather distributed to all individuals. The swiftness and era-defining levels of unemployment have largely overwhelmed existing relief infrastructures (OECD, 2020). Economic uncertainty persists in supply and demand due to high rates of savings, temporary business closures, and a sharp decrease in business activity (e.g., OECD, 2020). Demand is further hampered by high rates of unemployment and an uneasiness about future employment prospects (Johns Hopkins, 2020). A guaranteed source of revenue would provide the unemployed and underemployed with basic support while providing a safety net (should employment status change) for those with greater income to be less cautious about spending. This would lead to increased consumer confidence and spending. As governments work to respond to the pandemic and prepare for future ones, UBI is a possible policy answer for relief. Implementation of any social program creates long-term implications for individuals, society, and organizations. Society and the political process must address fundamental questions about wealth redistribution and the state's role in providing for citizens. A country's culture and values could affect its willingness to engage in such an economic shift, especially at it would include removal of many safety-net social programs (e.g., food-stamps and welfare). However, the economic benefits are bringing millions of people out of poverty and creating consumer demand (Lowrey, 2018). Long-term implementation of a UBI would be costly, but nations with large resource reserves might be better positioned to “earmark” revenue for a UBI as opposed to taxing businesses or wealthy individuals (Hanna & Olken, 2018). Some nations are better positioned to implement UBI than others. For instance, the political and social environment of some European nations would be more hospitable than more individualistic ones. In strongly capitalist societies, such as the United States, UBI is often been viewed negatively as a radical social experiment or even referred to as a “utopian” proposal (Van Parijs, 2013). Yet changing perceptions and political debate in several nations are bringing UBI closer to the mainstream (Bidadanure, 2019). For instance, Andrew Yang, a contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination for United States president, advocated for a UBI to address wealth inequities. Additionally, technology is fundamentally changing the nature of work. Automation is expected to displace 15% of the global workforce by 2030, and aid in completion of 30% of activities in most other jobs. While technology is expected to eliminate basic routine tasks from human employment, it is also expected to create more jobs than it eliminates. However, this means a different focus on training (vocational or educational) for future jobs (D'Mello, 2019). UBI programs could assist in the transition for many citizens from basic unskilled work to obtaining the training necessary to work in a more automated workplace. By providing a stable source of basic income, possibly offset by service or gig-economy jobs, individuals may be more inclined to start and finished educational or vocational programs. These programs can improve an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities, allowing them access to more lucrative employment, ultimately improving their economic standing. While beyond the scope of this study, important considerations also include the effects of UBI on crime, health, and families. The development, implementation, and regulation of a UBI program, while a daunting undertaking, could help to reduce inefficiency, redundancy, and bloating of the federal bureaucracy. The removal of other social programs would reduce the number of departments and general overhead spent across the various agencies. It would streamline benefits for recipients who would only need to interact with one entity instead of possibly several to receive different current aids (e.g., “food stamps” from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program administered locally through the Department of Agriculture, housing vouchers administered locally though public housing agencies associated with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Supplemental Security Income benefits administered by the Social Security Administration), increasing the likelihood of benefits reaching those who need it. It would facilitate dispensation of benefits with fewer threshold requirements for administrators to sift through or affect through judgment calls, while a streamlined, centralized office could increase oversight in regulation of benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a monumental challenge to address and accordingly may warrant unprecedented economic relief programs. As governments, organizations, and individuals are working to understand, confront, and navigate rapidly changing conditions, a UBI program represents a beneficial policy option to provide financial relief. Implementing a UBI allows for a measure of uncertainty in a post COVID-19 pandemic changed world.",https://doi.org/10.1002/pad.1891,The COVID‐19 pandemic: Time for a universal basic income?

35.52629,-35.302956,0,"1 Introduction Although Germany has a long-standing reputation as a passive welfare   with elaborate schemes of status-protecting income replacement through   insurance in case of unemployment and a full-blown system of active   market policies, all benefit systems had formal elements of activation and work requirement--but they had not been enforced systematically. In recent years, however, reforms of active and passive   market   were implemented in Germany in order to create a more activating   market and     regime and awake dormant activation principles. Changing the system of unemployment insurance benefits and basic income support as well as the repertoire of active   market   instruments and making benefit receipt more conditional upon job search and acceptance of job offers was a major issue on the political agenda. This led to a system shift away from Bismarckian status-protecting benefits towards a more Beveridgean model of income support with strong activation requirements. In the realm of unemployment benefits the dominant regime is no longer a   insurance benefit but a means-tested flat-rat transfer. The reform of the benefit system also involved a major overhaul of the governance of   market   and has far-reaching implications for the logic of the German welfare state. All these reforms generated considerable public attention and interest from foreign observers. This article provides an indepth account of the institutional change, its practical implementation and midterm outcomes and assesses if the desired economic and societal objectives of activation could be achieved through the adopted reforms. 2 The Shift towards Activation The Legacy of a Conservative European Welfare State The German welfare   is typically depicted as the prime example of the conservative welfare regime, for which the preservation of   status is central (Esping-Andersen 1990). It has also been prominently characterized as a frozen welfare state highly resistant to change (Manow and Seils 2000). Facing a difficult economic environment since the mid-seventies,   makers and   partners used active and passive   market policies to reduce   supply by taking surplus labor out of the   market and shifting the unemployed to benefit schemes and active programs that were not effectively oriented towards swift reintegration into the   market (Manow and Seils 2000). For some decades, active and passive   market policies provided a convenient and socially acceptable way of subsidizing entrepreneurial adjustment to dynamic global markets and help stabilize competitiveness of manufacturing that was at the core of the German employment system (Streeck 1997) while at the same time facilitating a social policy approach to unemployment emphasizing income protection and benevolent treatment through active policies. Availability of rather generous insurance-based   benefits related to   market status and skills in the tradition of a Bismarckian model helped limiting income inequality and wage dispersion. Rather than creating a flexible and more inclusive   market, the institutional arrangement of the German   market of the eighties and nineties was conducive to limiting low-wage employment and wage inequality. This model focusing skilled   was also stabilized by rather restrictive   market regulation (Estevez-Abe et al. 2001). Whereas this institutional pattern helped stabilize the core of the   market, it also resulted in a strong segmentation of the   market and   long-term unemployment. However, the German high equality, low activity equilibrium (Streeck 2001) resulted in an ever increasing burden of non-wage   costs as a growing number of benefit recipients in the   market directly translated into rising   security contributions and fiscal pressure on the   budget that was used to cover deficits in   insurance. …",,Activating Labor Market and Social Policies in Germany: From Status Protection to Basic Income Support

I defend two main claims in this paper. First, I argue that a universal and a conditional basic income do not provide a good solution to the problem of technological unemployment.

In the same year, the Castonguay-Nepveu Commission of Quebec suggested a similar scheme. In the early 1970s, a Social Security review reintroduced the concept.

At the time, it was widely believed that this experiment would serve as a pilot for a universal programme that would revolutionize the ways in which Canadians pay taxes, receive benefits and earn income. The oil shocks and persistent stagflation of the 1970s brought different governments to power at both the federal and provincial levels, and ended MINCOME without implementation of the anticipated universal basic income proposal.

We produce indexes and criteria according to which the reforms can be ranked and compared to the current tax-transfer systems. The exercise can be considered as one of empirical optimal taxation, where the optimization problem is solved computationally rather than analytically. It turns out that many versions of the Basic Income policies would be superior to the current system. The most successful policies are those involving non means-tested versions of basic income (Universal or Participation Basic Income) and adopting progressive tax-rules.

Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a system of cash transfers to citizens. Recent research suggests it could significantly benefit population health, including via reducing stress. However, a Finnish trial of a policy with similarities to UBI has influenced debate. This was reported as a failure due to a policy objective of reducing unemployment, despite demonstrating significant benefits to well-being. Aims and objectives: In this piece, we seek to advance the debate about the cost-benefit of UBI by identifying knowledge gaps and proposing a means of designing effective trials. Methods: We review UBI trial design and findings in comparison with social gradient in health literature and biopsychosocial theory to identify knowledge gaps. Findings: We highlight a need to refocus UBI trials on improved health, including via reduced stress, to provide policy makers the means of producing accurate cost-benefit analysis. Previous trials have either not reflected likely UBI policy or failed to measure impacts that enable accurate analysis. We contend that interdisciplinary work is required to establish trials that observe factors known to drive the social health gradient. Finally, we argue that statistical modelling is needed to extrapolate shorter-term findings to long-term population-level outcomes. Discussion and conclusions: Resource allocation by Government and/or major funders is required to produce evidence that enables accurate analysis of UBI.

The systematic comparison of the three institutional frameworks points out that Denmark, as the country where marriage and cohabitation are most equated by law, is surprisingly the country where the relative difference between marriage and cohabitation for a woman's financial satisfaction is the greatest.

-15.070521,15.12937,2,"Is a basic income both affordable and desirable? The Covid-19 crisis promises to be as big a shock to the UK economy as the 2007-08 financial crisis. The Office for Budget Responsibility recently published a scenario of the likely economic impact of the coronavirus shock to the economy. Making a number of assumptions, it suggested that real national income would fall by about a third in the second quarter of 2020. Public sector net borrowing would rise to about 14 per cent of national income, and this would be the highest annual deficit since the second world war.1 One idea for relieving the economic effects of the crisis is to implement a universal basic income. A basic income promises: ‘regular, non-means-tested cash transfers to all residents of a political territory on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement’.2 A universal basic income has five key parts, namely, that it: is regular; is paid in cash; is provided to the individual; is universal with no means test; and is unconditional with no requirement to work or seek work.3 Long-standing supporters of a basic income, such as Guy Standing, call for this policy to help people cope with the economic fallout of the global pandemic.4 This piece considers whether Covid-19 affects two key objections to a universal basic income among the left: adequacy and opportunity cost. “A full universal basic income has yet to be implemented in the world. Much existing evidence draws from pilots of partial basic income schemes in places such as Finland, as well as policy simulations” A second objection is that there are alternative policies that are better for relieving poverty. Indeed, critics claim that a universal basic income distracts time and resources from pursuing these other policies. Piachaud summarises this view: “What is perhaps most frustrating for those who see little attraction in pursuing a basic income is that, while it is part of a spectrum of social protection and social security measures, giving it pre-eminence diverts from the task of promoting more feasible and sensible reforms. There is a desperate need for more investment in human capital for the least advantaged and for more equal opportunities for all.”9 A range of arguments might be advanced both for and against the various claims that Piachaud makes in the above quotation (for example, the attention paid to investment in human capital for the least advantaged over a universal basic income). This piece does not delve into those arguments here as the focus is on the impact that Covid-19 has on a universal basic income. But the above quotation helps place the arguments about a universal basic income and Covid-19 within a broader context and set of debates. The global pandemic has already prompted some sceptics to rethink their views on a universal basic income.10 Covid-19 presents the need for rapid and immediate relief. It may be very complex to devise rapid and targeted help, and so universal income payments have the virtue of simplicity. This has been taken on board in the government response. For example, the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme provides a taxable grant to employers for furloughed employees worth 80 per cent of the employee's wage cost (up to £2,500 a month).11 A similar package of support is also provided to the self-employed. In the US, President Donald Trump signed an act promising $2 trillion of federal government help to households and businesses. Among the measures enacted are a set of economic impact payments that amount to $1,200 per person for one year and up to $500 for each child under 16 years of age.12 “Research suggests that the low-paid are among those hit worst by the coronavirus lockdown” Research suggests that the low-paid are among those hit worst by the coronavirus lockdown. One-third of employees in the bottom tenth of the earnings distribution work in sectors that are shut down, compared with 5 per cent of those in top tenth of the earnings distribution. Furthermore, women are more badly affected than men, with 17 per cent of female employees working in sectors that are shut down compared to 13 per cent of male employees.13 Many households are facing falls in income, but poorer households are less able to cope with drops in income because a larger part of their household budget is spent on essential items than richer households. On average, the poorest fifth of households spend around 55 per cent of their budgets on essential items, while the richest fifth spent around 39 per cent. This pattern is reversed for items that have been affected by social distancing measures such as travel, leisure or eating out.14 Clearly, poorer households are in greater need of help than richer ones in coping with Covid-19. This suggests that targeted income support may be the priority rather than universal income payments. “Government spending here arose from a very specific set of conditions that, one hopes, are unlikely to be repeated for some time” One might counter, though, that it is very difficult to draw general lessons from the exceptional nature of Covid-19. Government spending here arose from a very specific set of conditions that, one hopes, are unlikely to be repeated for some time. The 2007-08 financial crisis ushered in a decade of austerity. A Conservative government charged with dealing with the aftermath of Covid-19 might make similar fiscal choices, and this is without taking account on the pressures on public finances from Brexit. This alternative view offers a gloomier reading about the affordability of a universal basic income. While it is true that the bounds of government spending may be greater than often is presented in policy debates, it is unclear whether the Covid-19 crisis will seriously weaken the view that an adequate universal basic income is unaffordable. Again, it is likely that the best prospect is for a time limited scheme of emergency payments rather than a permanent income stream. The second objection to a universal basic income asks whether there are better alternatives for relieving poverty. One such alternative is universal basic services. The pandemic has made clear which services are deemed to be essential in a modern economy. The UK government published a list of key workers who are allowed to travel to their normal place of work during the crisis. These included those working in health services; transport; food supply; the police; and those working in utilities such as electricity, gas or water.16 These key worker sectors overlap considerably with calls for a welfare state built around universal basic services.17 There are seven core services in the model of universal basic services, namely: health care; education; shelter; food; transport; legal and democracy; and information. The aim is for these services to be publicly funded and be free at the point of delivery. Some services are familiar and are already provided in the welfare state such as the National Health Service. Other services are more novel. For example, an information service would provide free basic phone and internet access to all citizens. This proposal overlaps with the promise made in Labour's 2019 general election manifesto to provide free broadband for all,18 a pledge which was derided at the time in much of the media and public discussions. (Arguably, one failing of the manifesto was that it did not embed the broadband idea in a supporting policy approach such as universal basic services). “some aspects of a universal basic services approach are probably a greater priority at the moment than a universal basic income. But there is also a case for emergency income payments to help people and households cope with the immediate economic shocks from Covid-19” Schools were closed prior to the official lockdown. The education of schoolchildren depends largely upon them being able to access online lessons or homework from school. Evidence from Lloyds Bank Consumer Digital Index reports that in 2018, 700,000 11 to 18 year olds (12 per cent) have no internet access at home through a computer or tablet.20 Similarly, in the official lockdown period, employees who could work from home were instructed to do so. But the capacity to work also depends on access to the internet. And for the retired who are staying at home, the internet is a way for them to maintain social contacts. For these reasons, some aspects of a universal basic services approach are probably a greater priority at the moment than a universal basic income. But there is also a case for emergency income payments to help people and households cope with the immediate economic shocks from Covid-19. The questions of the best mix of universal basic services and emergency income payments to react to the crisis remains open. Covid-19 has caused a major shock to the economy. As politicians and policymakers grapple with its challenges, one initial response has been to refuel calls for a universal basic income. This piece suggests that, despite the flurry of interest, Covid-19 is unlikely to change the core arguments over a universal basic income. At best, the coronavirus makes a case for temporary emergency income payments. Turning these temporary payments into permanent ones requires engaging with the more usual arguments over a basic income heard in more usual times. Questions remain about the best mix of universal basic services and emergency income payments for reacting to the crisis, with one priority now being to address a digital divide.

We then provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of our preferred UGBI design and discuss the extension of that design to provincial tax and transfer systems.

Measuring labor burdens in order to adjust income shares, however, is no easy task. Some philosophers and economists attempt to sidestep the measurement problem by invoking the envy test. Yet a distribution in which no one prefers someone else’s circumstances to her own, as the envy test requires, is unlikely to exist—and, even if it does exist, the normative connection between the envy test and fairness has not been established. <italic>The Solidarity Solution</italic> provides a novel answer: when someone claims that her situation should be improved at someone else’s expense, she must be able to give a reason that cannot be rejected by a free and equal individual who regards everyone else as the same.

The paper then identifies the key criteria of social freedom. The extent to which the introduction of an UBI would meet these criteria is then examined, with a focus on the social role that stands to be most affected by an UBI, namely that of the worker-earner. It is argued that while an UBI is likely to be only partially effective as an instrument of specifically social freedom, its main justification lies not here, but in securing a basis for the subjective freedom that social freedom presupposes.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13698230.2019.1585152,"Basic income, social freedom and the fabric of justice"

The debate on the introduction of an Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) is beset with unanswered questions, with conjectures and unproven beliefs that call for additional research by economists and a uniform definition. The current distribution-and-income-based national welfare state could be transformed into a ‘prosperity state’, in which the economy is designed around delivering the capabilities for human flourishing. The introduction of a UBI, funded by progressive consumption and wealth taxes, should be on the research agenda of economics, and on the policy agenda in representative democracies. It has the potential to enlarge the economic pie, and to improve the distribution of income, for it reflects the contribution to society. Empirics on UBI are limited. Moreover, research is mainly focussed on short-term labour market effects, poverty and income inequality reduction, and there is some attention for health and well-being. However, the long-term effect on the environment are fully disregarded.

The universal basic income, which is simpler to manage and immune to moral hazard, may represent an interesting alternative in this context.

26.079988,3.9856215,4,"The practice of setting target growth rates for a year or more ahead for some measure of the mofiey supply is now followed by many industrialised countries. However it has been suggested by a number of authors (e.g. Meade (I978) in his Nobel prize lecture, Tobin (I980) in his retrospective on stabilisation policy, Brittan (I98I)) that it would be more sensible to pursue targets for nominal income rather than the money supply. Meade, for instance, argues that controlling nominal income is in any case the ultimate goal of those who favour fixed monetary targets, and that an excessive concentration on the means rather than the end is confusing to private agents and can lead to undesirable fluctuations in the demand for output when velocity shifts. He goes on to advocate that nominal income targets should be linked to the development of wage-fixing institutions designed to mimic competitive behaviour. In this paper we examine the implications of such a proposal for the performance of the economy in the context of a simple stochastic macroeconomic model under rational expectations. A contracting framework is adopted in which the wage is fixed in a state of uncertainty about future levels of demand and productivity. The objective of the authorities is to minimise the divergence of output from its full information equilibrium level. If labour supply is inelastic then it turns out that maintaining the level of nominal income is actually the optimal policy. If labour supply is elastic nominal income targetry provides an optimal response to demand (IS/LM) shocks but a suboptimal response to productivity shocks. However, a sufficient condition for a nominal income target to be preferable to a fixed money supply target is that the price elasticity of aggregate demand be less than unity. The paper concludes by examining the implications of pursuing target growth rates rather than levels. It should be conceded at the outset that there are several pertinent issues not addressed such as the greater comprehensibility of nominal income targets to private agents, or the possibility that nominal income targets may leave the authorities with too much discretion, e.g. Poole (I980). The issue of labour market reform is also ignored. This is an enormous subject which it would be impossible to do justice to here - see for instance Meade's own analysis of the problem in Meade (I982). Such reforms might be expected to affect the parameters of the model. Nevertheless since changes in labour market practices are neither a precondition for, nor a logical consequence of, nominal income targets, an independent analysis of the macrceconomic implications of the latter is still highly relevant.",https://doi.org/10.2307/2232747,TARGETING NOMINAL INCOME: AN APPRAISAL*
9.681162,-11.227783,4,"Economists have frequently argued that cash transfers are to be preferred to in-kind transfers. However, the argument is strictly true only where there are no market failures, and there are several arguments in favour of in-kind transfers that are valid in these circumstances In-kind transfers are often used where policy may be specifically concerned with the welfare of the recipient but a cash transfer cannot be made directly to the intended recipient. This might be the case with basic health care and education services for children where cash transfers would have to be made via the parents who might choose to spend such cash in a different fashion. This is called the agency problem. A second argument relates to the desire to exploit the stigma associated with visibly being in receipt of some transfer, in order to improve the targeting of such transfers to the most needy. This may be most relevant where recorded income may not be a good indicator of well-being such as may be the case in an economy with a large underground. The essence of this argument is that only the genuinely poor find it worthwhile to participate in the programme if it is stigmatised. In order to encourage only the poorest to select themselves into the programme the quality of the in-kind provision may have to be low: if the quality is a normal characteristic of a good then few of the richest will participate if the quality is low since they prefer a higher quality at the market price. Both of these arguments suggest that an in-kind transfer is not valued as highly as cash by the recipients: in the first case because the agent cannot trade the transfer for cash from which rent could be extracted; and in the second case because the value of the transfer is net of the costs of the stigma. The fact that in-kind transfers are worth less than cash but worth more to the poor than to the rich, offers the attractive prospect of being able to both relieve poverty and improve work incentives. In fact, in-kind transfers seem to be most prevalent in welfare schemes for those out-of-work while cash transfers are most commonly used for those in-work. At the same time as improving work incentives and improving the targeting of expenditure to alleviate poverty, in-kind transfers may be able to protect the welfare of children in poor households from adverse shocks associated with variations in parental income. Indeed, this is precisely why many such schemes were introduced. However, if family members are altruistic towards each other then there is the prospect that an in-kind transfer directly to one household member may be offset by some countervailing action by other household members. This so-called rotten-kid phenomenon severely undermines the case for in-kind transfers to children - if such transfers can be neutralised by some corresponding intra-household reallocation then not only is the affect on child welfare undermined but so too is the potential beneficial work incentive effect since the benefit of the transfer to the child could be appropriated by the parent. This paper is concerned with the effect of three UK nutrition programmes (free school lunches, school milk and welfare milk) on the household expenditure on milk and (non-milk) food. The aim of the paper is to estimate the extent to which households offset these in-kind transfers by reducing corresponding expenditures. Thus, the paper addresses the issue of the extent to which dependent children and parents are altruistically linked as well as the more conventional issue of the extent to which in-kind transfers are equivalent to cash. Our analysis is based on detailed modelling of the determinants of household expenditures and shows that households do offset these in-kind transfers - the effect is small for free school lunches suggesting that the agency problem may be small, but is large for the two milk schemes suggesting altruism is quite strong. The policy lesson is that in-kind transfers may not be desirable because agency is not a big problem and will typically not be effective unless what is being transferred would not typically be bought (a low quality school lunch for example).",https://doi.org/10.1920/wp.ifs.1997.9707,There is no such thing as a free lunch: evidence from the effect of in-kind transfers

This chapter discusses the nature of national income. Economic theory is conventionally divided into two main areas: (1) problems of resource allocation and price determination in individual markets and (2) the determination of the level of national income. The determination of the national income and other macroeconomic aggregates, especially the general levels of prices and employment, is a controversial area in economics. The schedules of savings and investment represent planned levels at different incomes. These desired levels will also be those actually achieved in equilibrium, but not otherwise. If the plans of the community for saving and investing exactly coincide, then total investment expenditure is precisely the same as the portion of its income that the community does not plan to consume.",https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-027442-3.50010-5,CHAPTER 5 – National Income

This analysis is extended to two income types where compulsory savings are found to be Pareto improving only up to a point. Increases in contribution rates beyond that point simply result in increasingly regressive (implicit) taxation, potentially eliminating all redistribution via the means tested basic income. Using these results in a pay-as-you-go framework, we show that an unfunded pensions system (with intragenerational fairness) plays a role similar to compulsory savings in preventing the savings moral hazard and could have the same adverse effects on redistribution if it is too large.

Critics point to its potentially negative effects on labor supply as individuals could have fewer incentives to seek, take or keep jobs. In this paper, we show that UI and UISAs are, in fact, particular cases of a more general design and that the crucial policy choice is in terms of how redistribution - to cover benefits for those who could not save enough - is financed. We outline key features of this general design and identify trade-offs and possible solutions.

The question of vital importance to the student of income involves the reason for the payment of income. It is a truism that the incomes of different persons are different. Why are they different? It is a truism that different people receive incomes for different reasons. What are some of the reasons? As in any other scientific problem, so here the question Why? is of paramount importance. The simplest and most obvious income relation would seem to be that existing between the participants in the productive process, and the returns which these participants receive in the course of distribution. These individuals have taken a part in creating values. Now they receive a part of the values which they have created, makes good reading, but it is very far from jibing with the facts. An analysis of any productive operation (such as the production of a ton of coal) leads at once to the conclusion that the participants in production and the sharers in distribution are not identical groups. The theorem that all incomes owe their origin to the productive processes is not followed by the corollary that only those who participate in the productive processes receive income. Indeed, the receipt of income carries with it very different connotations. All goods owe their origin to the productive processes. Flour, sugar, shoe-laces, bricks, and the like, are made from some product of the land, by labor with the aid of capital. Services are likewise possible only while the person rendering service is being supported with food and clothes which the productive processes have created.

Sustainable welfare is a novel research field that seeks to close this knowledge gap and develop integrated eco-social policies. Within this, researchers are starting to ask how citizen’s needs can be guaranteed in an environmentally sustainable way and how their welfare benefits should be delivered. Should citizens receive a universal basic income, be given vouchers for ecologically beneficial or socially needed goods and services, or be provided with access to socio-ecological infrastructures and services? This article develops a framework for sustainable welfare benefits with six criteria of sustainable welfare and nine different types of welfare benefits that belong to the domains of universal basic income (UBI), universal basic services (UBS), and universal basic vouchers (UBV). Using this framework, existing policy proposals are categorized and evaluated. The advantages and disadvantages of the different types of welfare benefits are discussed and new application areas highlighted. The analysis shows that a successful policy will likely include all forms of welfare benefits, with certain types being more adequate for certain fields and societal circumstances. The framework for sustainable welfare benefits can serve as a starting point for further research on integrated policy design and inform policymakers on the selection of eco-social policies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12020596,"Money, Vouchers, Public Infrastructures?

I argue that it is a result of a combination of changes in government policy and basic instabilities always inherent in the financial system. Policy changes increased the vulnerability of the pension system to those instabilities. The background to these changes and also the frame of reference in terms of which the “crisis” itself is now phrased is broadly neoliberal. Its theoretical roots are in ideas of the efficiency of free markets. Its policy roots are expressed in a series of similar neoliberal policy tendencies in other capitalist states. I further argue that neoliberal solutions to the pension crisis simply offer more of the very matters that created the problems in the first place. Moreover, the very terms of debate, based in markets, financialisation of saving and individualisation of risk, disguise a more basic debate about providing a living retirement income for all.

37.97869,-7.0568304,4,"Abstract In Germany, both policy makers and researchers have been searching for solutions to overcome the disincentives on labor supply generated by income allowances for welfare recipients (Unemployment Benefit II). Taking proposals of the German Economic Institute (IW) and the governing Liberal Party (FDP) as a starting point, the German Federal Government has intensely discussed this topic during fall 2010 and finally proposed a reform in legislation. In this study, we analyze the potential labor supply effects of the legislated reform and the preceding proposals. In a second step, we augment the different scenarios with a working hours requirement to ensure that only those are subsidized, whose earned income is low due to low hourly wages rather than few working hours. Our simulations confirm the well-known trade-off of in-work benefits: Without working time requirement they tend to create incentives for welfare recipients to increase their labor supply, such that overall labor supply rises. However, the more generous the allowable income regulation, the more expensive the reform gets for the government budget. This comes mainly from the increasing incentive to reduce working hours for those located around the phasing-out level of income. This predominantly affects secondary earners. A working hours requirement reduces these effects and causes more favorable labor market effects and consequently much lower fiscal costs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2516.2010.00348.x,Reform der Hartz IV-Hinzuverdienstregelungen: Ein verfehlter Ansatz
-10.520497,35.70914,2,"The relevant basic principle for overall distribution in macrojustice turns out to be the relevant equality of liberties. This study shows the consequence of this fact for the optimum distribution, taxation, and transfers of income. The liberties in question are social liberty (freedom from forceful interference, basic rights), and the possibilities offered by domains of choice which can provide equal liberty while being different for individuals with different productivities.

The method is deductive from the basic relevant concepts.

The result is that this distribution consists of an equal sharing of the proceeds of the same labour for all individuals (with their different productivities). The individuals choose freely their total labour (with no other tax). This redistributive structure is Equal-Labour Income Equalization or ELIE. It also has a number of other important meanings, such as: general balanced labour reciprocity (each yields to each other the proceeds of the same labour); equal basic universal income financed by an equal labour of all; and uniform linear concentration to the mean of the distribution of total incomes (including the value of leisure).

This result extends to multidimensional labour (duration, education, intensity, etc.), and to partial labour including unemployments.

The practical application relies on exemption of overtime labour from the income tax, and a tax credit. This is successfully applied in some countries.

This constitutes a new paradigm of optimum income distribution and taxation. The old paradigm was based on welfarism not found relevant by society for this application, and it has therefore never been applied.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s1049-2585(08)16001-x,Equal liberties and the resulting optimum income distribution and taxation

Results demonstrate that the effectiveness of universal basic income on long-term growth, inequality, and welfare depends on the type of fiscal policy adopted by government to fund it, notably the trade-off between increasing the tax base or reducing public spending. First, under normal circumstances, universal basic income funded by completely eliminating oil subsidies appears to be the best policy for reducing inequality while increasing growth and welfare. Second, when the currency union faces a crisis, a universal basic income funded by increases in different taxes is more effective in combating stagflation and inequality than a universal basic income funded by total oil subsidy elimination. The welfare analysis confirms that, universal basic income funded by the increase in tax on capital gains and the increase in tax on corporate income is successful in reducing income inequality and consumption inequality and improving households’ living standards, its effects lead to higher welfare gains when the economy faces a crisis rather than the economy in normal times.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jge.2023.100075,"Tax policy reform and universal basic income effectiveness in a currency union: Implications for long-term growth, inequality, and welfare"

A European BI experiment should focus on the question of policy effectiveness. The question of policy effectiveness should be formulated as follows: what policy (BI, the current system, or any other alternatives to be tested) produces the greatest increase in welfare for the poor (or the greatest decrease in poverty) per Euro of cost (both in terms of tax cost and efficiency loss)? Effectiveness is not the only important concern in assessing policy alternatives, but it is a critically important concern that anyone who is interested in the issue should consider.

Recent UBI debates and experiments have drawn attention to fundamental questions about the nature and value of work and to the role and objectives of social and labor market policy. The renewed interest in UBI has also (re)ignited important discussions on the specifics of whether and how basic income schemes could address the limitations and unintended effects of existing social protection policies and on the role of cash transfer policy design and implementation details in shaping work outcomes.

15.854898,-37.409504,0,"Workfare is an exemplar of neoliberal welfare reform generating precarity. In response, critics have sought to advance a politics of universalism, through either a return to social democracy or the embrace of a universal basic income. Yet, these responses invoke different understandings of universalism. This paper explores the politics of universalism in the context of neoliberal reform to benefit systems. Using Australia as a case study, it applies a variegated understanding of neoliberalism to identify two distinct reform trajectories for family payments and unemployment benefits. While appearing to follow a common template of liberalization, in practice each trajectory fostered distinct social outcomes and political dynamics. I argue the more inclusive restructuring of family benefits reflected the influence of social movement pressure intersecting with an increasingly pro-competition and technocratic state, producing new, hybrid, patterns of universal social provision similar to forms of basic income. However, in reflecting on these political dynamics I highlight how the mobilization of universalism is contingent on existing welfare institutions, suggesting dangers in applying these lessons more broadly.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0896920519872800,"Advancing Universalism in Neoliberal Times?

-4.9377546,-10.6095915,0,"The introduction of an unconditional basic income (UBI) has been a long-lasting debate in most of the modern welfare states. Although it has not yet been implemented anywhere it generates a lot of interest. Independent of its actual implementation, a UBI consists of the idea of a unitary social transfer to everyone in society, replacing many if not all existing transfers. This new transfer is no longer means tested. Hence, it is not subject to the household situation or even the willingness to work. The arguments for this include an increase in social justice, a reduction of poverty, and a raise in individual freedom. The arguments against focus mainly around the abandonment of the subsidiarity principle. Critics also fear that an unconditional payment would reduce labour market participation especially for low-income households. Furthermore, given the nature of a negative income tax scheme, full poverty extinction combined with high incentives to work could not be financed.",https://doi.org/10.4337/9781788116060.00017,Basic income: Insights from social experiments and simulations

We explore the effects of how UBI is framed (either in the context of values or the context of policy), finding three key results. First, UBI is primarily a Democratic and liberal policy. Second, negative arguments against UBI move support for UBI more than positive arguments. Third, and surprisingly, respondents are equally affected by both policy‐driven and value‐driven arguments about UBI. In conclusion, an increase in messaging about UBI is likely to widen existing partisan differences in UBI support. These differences are unlikely to be won over by policy or values arguments.",https://doi.org/10.1111/spol.12760,Measuring and framing support for universal basic income

Underlying this idea are two important claims: (1) all individuals in society hold an ex. ante entitlement in job resources and (2) job resources are tradable: First, I present the real-libertarian argument for sharing job resources. Next, I identify and critically review three different objections against this view: the liability objection, the cooperation objection and the parasitism objection. I believe the parasitism objection poses a serious challenge to basic income, and argue that Van Parijs’s most plausible response-based on the idea that job resources are socially owned-is flawed. I provide the outline of an alternative normative basis for grounding a person's ex ante entitlement to job resources using an institutionalist approach.",https://doi.org/10.1515/auk-2000-0205,Sharing Job Resources: Ethical Reftections on the Justification of Basic Income

This welfare state model describes the strong preference for market-based solutions in meeting social needs (commodification), a residual safety net, and a punitive approach to poverty (Esping-Andersen, 2000; Grover & Piggott, 2013). Other scholars have suggested that the characterization of Australia and New Zealand as liberal welfare states downplays some unique characteristics and that it is more accurate to talk about Australia and New Zealand as having developed a “wage earner’s welfare state” (Castles, 1984). The notion of a wage earner’s welfare state emphasizes the central role given to high minimum wages in redistribution, a generous social wage, and a robust system of industrial rights. These aspects were supported by the substantial use of protective tariffs to bolster wage levels in manufacturing, urban service, and a strong concern with the regulation of labor supply through controlled migration (Castles, 1994).",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137535320_1,Neoliberal Frontiers and Economic Insecurity: Is Basic Income a Solution?

Two models for solving the problem are frequently proposed: a work model, which in its radical version institutes a legally binding right to employment, and a basic income model, which in its radical form establishes a universal, unconditional right to income security. In practice, western democracies have experimented with mixed forms of both models, with a greater emphasis on guaranteeing work.

Typically, programmes provide regular and reliable transfers in cash to households in poverty, with transfers conditional on children attending school and on household members attending health clinics. Rigorous impact evaluations have established that, on the whole, programmes reach their explicit objectives, especially as regards nutrition, childrens schooling and improved health care utilisation. It is too early to say whether human development programmes will be successful in reducing the intergenerational persistence of poverty in the region. To certain degree, this will depend on whether they contribute to the economic and political inclusion of groups in poverty and extreme poverty. To the extent that improvements in childrens schooling and health state cannot guarantee a successful inclusion in the labour market, or that transfers reinforce longstanding clientelistic practices in the region; the fuller economic and political inclusion of these groups might not materialise.

Based on 30 interviews with Hungarian university students, we investigate the attitudes of young citizens to the introduction of UBI in a hypothetical scenario, situated in 2060, when technological unemployment is high. Interviewees expressed optimistic views about the future labour market and dismissed the scenario, preferring the option of job‐creation. Students claimed that people would become useless members of society by not working, which argument echoes the Hungarian government's discourse about the need for work‐based society. Students also stressed that work gives meaning to life.

In this paper we want to explore the feasibility, the desirability and the features of a universal policy of minimum income in Italy. We use a microeconometric model and a social welfare methodology in order to evaluate various alternatives mechanisms. We simulate the effects and the social welfare performance of 30 reforms resulting from six versions of five basic types of income support mechanism: guaranteed minimum income (GMI), universal basic income (UBI), wage subsidy (WS) and two mixed systems: GMI+WS and UBI+WS. As welfare evaluation criteria we adopt the Gini Social Welfare function and the Poverty-Adjusted Gini Social Welfare function. All the reforms are calibrated so as to preserve fiscal neutrality. The simulation adopts a methodology that allows for market equilibrium and ensures a consistent comparative statics interpretation of the results. Universal and non mean-tested transfers (possibly complemented by wage subsidy) emerge as desirable and feasible features of the income support mechanism. In the most realistic scenarios, the social-welfare-optimal policies are a modest unconditional transfer amounting to 40% of the poverty line complemented by a 10% wage subsidy or – depending on the social welfare criterion – a more generous unconditional transfer (100% of the poverty line). The reforms can be financed by proportionally increasing the current marginal tax rates and widening the tax base to include all personal incomes. The set of universalistic policies that are preferable to the current system is very large and gives the opportunity of selecting a best reform according to many different criteria.",,Five Issues in the Design of Income Support Mechanisms: The Case of Italy *

-21.37115,26.153145,2,"1. Basic Income: what are we talking about?The idea of   Basic Income grant to provide for fundamental life needs dates back   long time in the history of the broader ius existentiae debate (Bronzini, 2011). Basic Income sits in the debate concerning the historical issue of wealth redistribution, rather in the discussion about the allocation of that amount of affluence generated by   determined social order, in   specific historical time. Indeed, we will see how Basic Income focuses directly on the relationship between social and productive organization, which is at the heart of the capitalist contemporary mainstream development model (Gorz, 2009).A first attempt to summarize this historical debate and to equip research of   commonly shared definition of Basic Income has been led by the philosopher Philippe Van Parijs and the political scientist Yannick Vanderborght. In their book, L'Allocation Universelle, they not only rebuild   thoroughly genesis of the principle of ius ad vitam, but they also refine what is today the most notorious explanation of Basic Income: a revenue paid individually by   political community to all its members, without   means test and working requirements (Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2005, trad. it. 2006:5). However, despite this first conceptual framing, which at first glance appears to undermine the social stratification basis in terms of material and symbolic rewards, it is still missing   deeper level of specification to clarify the following issues: How much does Basic Income amount to? Who are the exact targets? Is it   distributive or re-distributive measure? The extraordinary multitude of approaches and methods employed throughout time to identify the mechanisms of wealth creation have led to   great confusion in the definition of what   Basic Income is and how it should work.To this day, there has been   partial attempt to shed light on the fragmented terminology in the final report of the   Parlamentare per l'analisi delle compatibilita macroeconomiche della spesa sociale (so called Commissione Onofri, Roma, 1997)1. Here, the Italian sociologists Chiara Saraceno and Maurizio Ferrera have tried to outline some pathways, addressed to the national Italian government, that will provide for   direct support to individual income. In spite of that, together with Greece, Italy is still today the only European country lacking   national-net of income support. Saraceno and Ferrera have sketched out   distinction among some of the most employed terms for individual cash transfers: Basic Income, Citizenship Income, Guaranteed Minimum income, Insertion Income and Last Resort income. However, we are still lacking   careful taxonomy of the several measures calling for   cash transfer and of the resulting levels of social protection.The whole redistributive debate orbits around two main phenomenological axes: the crisis of the fordist labour and the crisis of the related welfare system (Sennet 2006, Rifkin 2002, Fraser-Honnet 2003, Paci 2007, De Masi 1999, Mantegna-Tiddi 1997). Therefore, we must interpose the research on the Basic Income idea between the passing of the wage society and the overcoming of the charitable state (Accornero 1997, Paci 2007, Fumagalli, 1997b). For this reason, in this review I will go over the main literature dealing with the idea of Basic Income. First, I will try to outline   brief historical bibliography about the issue of ius existentiae. Secondly, I will provide an empirical picture of the experiences of such   monetary transfer. Thirdly, I will depict   general map of the socio-economic approaches to Basic Income in the contemporary redistributive debate. In conclusion, I will attempt to point out   possible research direction.2. The historical background2.1 The Humanist rootsThe idea of   right to the essential means for life is certainly not new (Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2005, trad. it. 2006).

Somewhat dissatisfied with these treatments the article at hand develops an alternative account of the function Rawls has in mind for work. It will be argued that within Rawls’s idea of a just society the societal role of work consists of three components: an ‘efficiency component’, a ‘self-respect, component’, and a ‘sense of community component.’ Based on that, reconstruction of the Rawlsian position I will investigate whether such a position is reconcilable with the demand for an unconditional Basic Income.

16.223804,15.405116,4,"While the idea of advancing technology and society are often of primary interest to academics, the general public is frequently challenging the integration of these advancements within society. This complex issue is most often discussed around the role of robots in manufacturing where both repetitive and dangerous tasks performed by humans are being replaced by robotic counterparts that in many cases, can also perform these tasks more accurately. Similarly, the idea of automation through artificial intelligence poses a risk to workers far beyond physical labor, a topic highly discussed for the past few years. From this concern, theories on bringing your own robot to work, analogous to the bring your own device to work movement, have been brought up as a way into the future. Separately, in order to offset the economic downsides of the changing human labor force, and among other reasons, recent political discussions have been actively pursuing the idea of a universal basic income. This paper poses an alternative idea, one in which the advantages of robotics continues to benefit the laborers in which it replaces, and takes the bring your own robot to work to a macro scale: a universal basic robot. These two past proposals, one in which people bring their own robot to work, and one in which a universal basic income is given, have large differences in the way society itself will transform.

The author proposes the notion of a caring revolutionary transformation as a process of institutionalising the social and economic conditions for recognition of care which is a cornerstone of struggles for women’s emancipation and gender equity. It is a process of practically realisable transformative steps which together with their combined and mutually reinforcing effects enable more radical social changes beyond a mere reform. The author argues that these transformative steps have to address two conditions embedded in the institutionalised structures of late modern capitalist society: the limited understanding of meaningful work as paid employment; and the liberal ideal of the independent and autonomous individual. Whereas a UBI can challenge the first condition, a public model of care questions the second condition by shifting the primary responsibility of care from the family towards a social solidarity. While insufficient when introduced separately, the combination of these two remedies has the potential to radically alter social structures on which gendered inequalities rest.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2017-0019,Caring Revolutionary Transformation: Combined Effects of a Universal Basic Income and a Public Model of Care

We therefore employ an approach based on a responsibility‐sensitive theory of justice that decomposes individual income into fair and unfair components. As a proxy for distributional unfairness, unfair income is considered the main source of unhappiness. Using data from the Chinese Household Income Project survey, we find strong support for the negative relationship between income unfairness and happiness.

Contrarily to job guarantee program (MGNREGS) or to food, fuel or fertilizer subsidies, UCT provide cash to their beneficiaries. In contrast with conditional cash transfers (CCT), such as free mid-day meals or the maternity benefit program, basic income —a type of UCT— does not target a specific population. What would be the advantages and drawbacks of a basic income as compared to existing schemes? How does empirical evidence support arguments in favor or against a basic income? What is the scope for a basic income, given the financial capacity of the State and the available technology? These questions will be addressed in turn, in order to assess the potential for this ambitious policy.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3557348,A Basic Income for Indians: Desirability and Feasibility

46.33276,-22.197119,4,"Since the 1990s and the 2000s, Western social protection systems have experienced a turn towards activation. This turn consists of the multiplication of measures aimed at bringing those who are unemployed closer to participation in the labour market. These measures often induce a strengthening of the conditions that must be met in order to receive social benefits. It is in this well known context that the authors gathered in this book decided to take a closer look at the relationship between activation policies for the unemployed and the right and the duty to work. If activation measures are likely to increase transitions towards the labour market, we can also make the assumption that they may, particularly when they are marked with the seal of coercion, hinder or dramatically reduce the right to freely chosen work. In such circumstances, the realisation of the «right to work», which is often stated to be the aim of those who promote activation, tends in practice to be reduced to an increasing pressure being exerted on the unemployed. In this case, isn’t it actually the duty to work that is particularly reinforced? After an historical and philosophical perspective on the issue, this assumption is confronted with the developments observed in the United States and in France, and then with the guidelines laid down in international human rights instruments. What follows is a discussion of two alternatives to the dominant activation model: the basic income guarantee and the employment guarantee.",https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-0352-6495-1,"Activation Policies for the Unemployed, the Right to Work and the Duty to Work"

This combination of factors has led some analysts to explore new ways to deliver welfare state benefits, or reconfigure them. But others speculate that existing welfare state policies have run their course, and cannot be easily repaired to cope with these multiple challenges, especially in the face of slower and less labor-intensive economic growth. Some advocates are calling for introducing a universal basic income (UBI), either as a floor to provide a basic level of subsistence, as a complement to existing welfare state policies, or in some cases as a replacement for the welfare state. Much of the current interest in UBI stems from a belief that technology is rapidly eliminating jobs faster than new ones can be created, and future job growth will be much lower. But the evidence on technological displacement seems too uncertain to justify major disruptions in the welfare state.

Indeed, according to legislators and the U.S. patent office, IP “creates jobs.” But this is not quite right. The purpose of IP is to increase the amount of innovation in the economy. Yet a significant subset of the innovations protected by IP, from self-service kiosks to self-driving cars, are in fact labor-saving. They reduce the amount of human labor required to complete a task. Therefore, to the extent IP is successful at incentivizing innovation, IP actually contributes to job loss. More precisely, IP contributes to what this article terms technological un/employment: job loss, and job creation, resulting from technological change. Commentators concerned about the “end of work” have suggested using taxation to slow down the pace of automation and provide aid to displaced workers. But this article yields another surprising insight: IP law itself could be designed to effectuate similar goals, either alone or in coordination with the tax system. For example, rather than taxing businesses that employ robots, legislators could deny patents on robots, or tax IP owners and use the proceeds to fund social programs like a universal basic income. IP’s relationship to technological un/employment, and the implications for public policy, seem obvious in hindsight. Yet the connection has been overlooked.

We also find that more individualistic and competitive people increase their labour supply even when the UBI is introduced. The conjecture that the UBI makes people lazier is rejected. As for the adverse selection problem, we apply a simple evolutionary game model in order to check whether the introduction of the UBI promotes freedom and self-maintenance of the people who have a weaker position in the household, such as women, children, people of advanced age, and people with disability.

This research examines hedonic adaptation to income changes, and asks whether people adapt more slowly to social or temporal income changes.

This pattern holds for both negative changes (Experiment 1) and positive changes (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) and can be explained by a differential-consideration account (Experiment 3). These results suggest that in the short run, both temporal and social changes influence one's hedonic experience, but in the long run, what influences one's hedonic experiences is how much one earns relative to how much others earn, and not how much one earns now relative to how much one earned in the past.

If degrowth is inevitable, the question is how it can become socially sustainable, i.e. a prosperous and stable, rather than a catastrophic, descent. Pricing mechanisms alone are unlikely to secure smooth adaptation; a full ensemble of environmental and redistributive policies is required, including – among others – policies for a basic income, reduction of working hours, environmental and consumption taxes and controls on advertising. Policies like these, that threaten to “harm” the economy, are less and less likely to be implemented within existing market economies, whose basic institutions (financial, property, political, and redistributive) depend on and mandate continuous economic growth. An intertwined cultural and political change is needed that will embrace degrowth as a positive social development and reform those institutions that make growth an imperative.

Assuming that basic income can be seen as a radical extension of the universal welfare state, we pursue this question by investigating whether popular reactions towards a basic income proposal are susceptible to persuasion that invokes attitudes towards immigration. The study is based on survey data covering a representative sample of the Norwegian electorate. We find that a comfortable majority express sympathy with the idea of a basic income, and that the structure of initial support for the basic income proposal is well in line with established findings concerning attitudes towards welfare state institutions and redistributive policies more generally. However, by applying a persuasion experiment, we show that negative attitudes towards immigration can be mobilized to significantly reduce the scope of support for a basic income proposal among the Norwegian electorate.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0001699306071682,The Limits of Social Solidarity

In recent years, however, reforms of active and passive labour market policy were implemented in Germany in order to create a more activating labour market and social policy regime through awakening dormant activation principles. Changing the system of unemployment insurance benefits and basic income support as well as the repertoire of active labour market policy instruments and making benefit receipt more conditional upon job search and acceptance of job offers was a major issue on the political agenda. The reform of the benefit system also involved a major overhaul of the governance of labour market policy and has far-reaching implications for the logic of the German welfare state. All these reforms generated considerable public attention and interest from foreign observers. Yet, it remains to be seen to what extent activation is really implemented in practice and if the desired economic and societal objectives of activation could be achieved through the reforms adopted.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-77435-8_2,Activation Policies in Germany: From Status Protection to Basic Income Support

A UBI would direct much larger shares of transfers to childless, nonelderly, nondisabled households than existing programs, and much more to middle-income rather than poor households. A UBI large enough to increase transfers to low-income families would be enormously expensive. We review the labor supply literature for evidence on the likely impacts of a UBI.

42.602108,-6.469089,4,"AN ASSESSMENT OF MINORITY INCOME DIFFERENCES AND GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES Raphael Thelwell* I. INTRODUCTION This paper examines factors that have contributed to a new social envi- ronment which places lower priorities on equalizing minority opportunities; the impact of that environment on governmental policies that contributed to the 1981 recession and increased minority income differences; and the impli- cations of the effects of current decisions on the future economic well-being of minorities. Suggestions are offered for changing this new environment, and for the development of more appropriate governmental policies for re- ducing income differences. The environment for public decisions is strongly influenced by continuing confusion between the progress of working minori- ties and the lack of progress of minorities as a group. This mistake has con- tributed to the majority belief that minority economic progress has been rapid and will automatically continue as a result of built-in features of this society. In addition, the willful actions of the government in contributing to the 1981 recession are briefly examined and the available recourse of minorities in a majority society is considered. Reagonomics as an approach to reduc- ing future minority income differences is examined and alternatives offered in terms of governmental, and minority community actions. Higher levels of output, which has only been produced by close govern- mental and private enterprise cooperation, is a necessary condition for dis- turbing existing social consensus on the role of minorities and is a prerequisite to closing the income gap. It is argued that a more favorable environment must be based on the majority realizing the advantages of fully utilizing the unused resources of the minority community. The imperatives of international economic competition are making it increasingly difficult to inefficiently used minority resources. Moreover, growing international com- petition is strongest in those industries which employ large numbers of mi- nority workers. Future improvement will be even more difficult because the cumulative effect of past efforts to reduce discrimination have not produced significant improvements in the income ratio in more progressive regions, urban areas or industries. The improvement has been achieved by minorities shifting to more favorable regions, industries and occupations; by converging produc- tive characteristics; and by reductions in the more flagrant discriminatory practices.

This paper examines the sense in which the Australian system is selective, and discusses the distinction between selectivity and targeting in income support provisions. Developments in social security outlays and recipient numbers over the last two decades are compared with those occurring since 1983, in order that the nature and impact of recent policies introduced to increase targeting can be identified. The analysis indicates that increases in recipient numbers have been the dominant factor underlying the past growth in social security expenditure. The distinction between selectivity and targeting of income support provisions is then explained with reference to the concepts of eligibility and entitlement. A framework is developed to illustrate how recent policies have restrained the growth in social security recipient numbers by policies which have increased income support targeting. These moves have not always produced a consistently more selective system of income support, an issue which is explored with the use of an index of the degree of selectivity of social security expenditures developed specifically for this purpose.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400018900,Selectivity and Targeting in Income Support: The Australian Experience

Not only does this contrast with the prevailing global trend of retrenchment in public welfare systems, but the proposed ‘basic income grant’ in South Africa is an innovation that remains a fringe idea even in the established welfare states of the North. The very unusual agenda for welfare reform in South Africa is based on the fact that the country already has a welfare system that is exceptional in the world, including especially a non‐contributory old‐age pension that provides a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly, and financial assistance to poor parents with children and to the disabled. The basic income grant has been proposed, most recently in 2002 by the Taylor Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security for South Africa, in order to fill the gap caused by high unemployment in South Africa's existing welfare system, which is otherwise already generous and redistributive. Whilst the proposed basic income grant is the key item on South Africa's innovative reform agenda, the country is also making important contributions to broader debates over welfare through its mix of familial, state and private responsibilities.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02533950208458731,The Broader Importance of Welfare Reform in South Africa
46.67898,-22.488516,4,"In this paper I challenge the implicit (and sometimes explicit) claim of Adam Smith that the free market is a natural system which would emerge on its own if governments did not interfere. I argue instead that the free market is a tenuous human institution which needs support and protection. I build my claim upon Adam Smith's open avowal that property rights are necessary for the free market and upon the neo-liberal demand that governments must intervene in order to maintain the competitive nature of the free market so as to guarantee its efficiency. Hegel incorporates both claims that property rights and economic efficiency are necessary. For Hegel both are necessary for achieving freedom. I then point out that defending the above two claims with the philosophical argument that they contribute to freedom implies that both property rights and economic efficiency must not be allowed to undermine freedom. This provides the philosophical foundation for minimal welfare measures: society must make it possible for all to acquire the property necessary for exercising freedom or to enjoy the fruits of socially enforced efficiency. Hegel thereby teaches us that a philosophical reflection upon the writings of Adam Smith and the doctrines of neo-liberalism provide an argument in favor of some form of welfare state. Borrowing from Hegel, I then point out that any welfare state contradicts a basic principle of the free market: no one gets something for nothing. For this reason, I believe that alleviating poverty in a free market system is always going to be a tenuous affair.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.350280,Ethical Tasks in a Free Market Economy According to Classical and Neo-Liberal Economists

Rather than replacing traditional welfare, 'workfare' is thus reinstated at its heart: the destitute are given a minimum income in exchange for their goodwill, which they must henceforward manifest by a willingness to work, real or simulated. This article draws on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in a region of central France to dissect how these new processes of 'moralization' of the poor unfold at ground level. Reconstructing the strategies used by recipients of the RMI (France's guaranteed minimum income allocation) and by those who control them brings to light the ordinary scenes of social life wherein the obligation to work is reasserted and uncovers the chain of connections between different sites and scenes from the bottom to the top of the new world of public assistance, linking the most disposssessed to the local notables of the political and administrative apparatus.",,Scenes of a public policy in a French province

Examination of the rhetoric used by both parties shows that there are three main focal points of comparison. On one level there is a shared belief in the cohesive impetus of realistic ‘aspiration’ in a stratified society. On another, there is a mutual desire to balance individual ‘rights’ with communal ‘responsibilities’. Finally, there is a common concern over the apperceived problem of the ‘underclass’ and how to deal with it. On the basis that these interrelated topics influenced social policy through the intensity of debate around them, the piece moves on to set the resultant American and British models of ‘workfare’ alongside the proposed ‘New Deals’ of New Labour. This has a threefold purpose. First, by detailing these examples the influence of the likes of Charles Murray and Lawrence Mead in future Labour policy may be observed. Second, the American association is particularly important in that the theoretical basis and practical experience of US social policy in the 1980s can act as an actual, realized example of the problems facing the proposed welfare policies of New Labour. Third, this comparison allows the piece to move on and discuss the failings of such authoritarian welfare programmes in the light of modern capitalism and modern society.

Popular support for ten essential income transfer schemes in Finland is determined. Some of these schemes represent purely means-tested programmes, others are universal. Programmes also vary in their importance to different subgroups of the population. The results give qualified support to the ‘welfare backlash’ model: universal benefits are found to be more legitimate than selective ones. However, the situation is a little more complicated. Benefits maintaining basic security are also highly legitimate, which indicates that people do not support social security schemes only out of selfish motives. They also have a moral commitment to help those in need.

It can be defended from both a liberal-libertarian perspective as a replacement for existing benefits and social insurance (with Friedman often cited in this sense, although his negative tax proposal is fora family-based system; Capitalism and Freedom, p. 159),or from a progressive standpoint, in which case the basic income would be added to most existing benefits and social insurance. It is more in this second sense that the BIEN (2013) advocates a basic income, although the liberal aspect of the measure is also assumed: It's the most liberal solidarity principle one can get, as it ensures individual existence and social cohesion, without the rigidity of interventionism and no oppressing bureaucracy.

The review and development of policy options was scheduled to be completed by 1975 with the implementation of chosen options to take a further two or three years. A prominent and much debated policy option with respect to income security was a guaranteed annual income.

However, a higher pension without a means test would in four cases out of five mean misdirecting aid to those not in need. Even in cases where the current statutory pension entitlement is lower than the entitlement to basic provision (Grundsicherung), as part of a combined household income the pension still usually succeeds in averting old age poverty. It would therefore make more sense to deduct a personal allowance from the means test, irrespective of the type of income involved. An allowance of up to 200 euros per month would benefit almost all those originally identified as potentially needing assistance if they simultaneously claimed basic provision. However, this would involve the needy being treated differently depending on their individual income in old age. Alternatively, to avoid this unequal treatment, the standard rates of old-age basic provision could be raised for all indigent pensioners. While it would raise the number of potential beneficiaries, this should be interpreted less as an alarm signal than as an indication of an effective old-age pension system.

ABSTRACT This paper mounts a Rawlsian argument for unconditional basic income on the grounds that it maximins the distribution of income and wealth understood as a social basis of self-respect. The most important objection to this argument available to Rawlsians is that basic income violates the demands of reciprocity, where reciprocity in any scheme of distribution is a requirement of justice. The second half of the paper addresses this objection. It is argued there that even if the objection can be made successfully by Rawlsians (and this is not clear), it is not sufficient to divest them of a commitment to basic income, given some practical considerations about the implementation of alternatives to basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5930.00243,"Basic Income, Self-Respect and Reciprocity"

We focus on the 27 EU member states over the period 2007-2011, using data from the European Quality of Life Survey. Individual well-being is measured by equivalent income, which is equal to the actual income minus the monetary value of suffering from not having the best achievements in non-income dimensions. Cross-country comparisons of these statistics and their growth rates show that going â€œbeyond incomeâ€ makes a substantial difference. In particular, we find that when social welfare is measured by an index sensitive to both mean well-being and its inequality, leaving out non-income dimensions, especially health, from well-being measurement, would leave unexplained more than half of the cross-country variation in social welfare. Taking non-income dimensions into account affects more the part of social welfare that is inequality-sensitive than the one that is mean sensitive.",https://doi.org/10.3326/pse.44.4.1,Does going beyond income make a difference?

In contrast, various areas of empirical research in psychology (studies of intrinsic motivation; non-pecuniary benefits of work on social identity and purpose; and reactions to financial windfalls such as lottery winnings) suggest that a BIG would not lead to meaningful reductions in work. To test these competing predictions, a comprehensive review of BIG outcome studies reporting data on adult labor responses was conducted. The results indicate that 93 % of reported outcomes support the prediction of no meaningful work reductions when the criterion for support is set at less than a 5 % decrease in either average hours worked per week or the rate of labor participation. Overall, these results indicate that adult labor responses would show no substantial impact following a BIG intervention.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2018-0011,Would a Basic Income Guarantee Reduce the Motivation to Work?

It then presents simple, “back-of-the-envelope” estimates of the net cost of a UBI set at about the official poverty line: $12,000 per adult and $6,000 per child with a 50 % “marginal tax rate.” These back-of-the-envelope calculations present a greatly simplified UBI scheme meant not as a practical proposal but as a method to obtain a ballpark estimate of the cost of UBI in isolation. Even with simplifying assumptions, these figures are several times more accurate than many common but exaggerated estimates. Key findings of this study include the following. The net cost — the real cost — of this UBI scheme is $539 billion per year: about one-sixth its often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful gross cost of about $3.415 trillion. The net cost of this UBI scheme is less than 25 % of the cost of current U.S. entitlement spending, less than 15 % of overall federal spending, and about 2.95 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The average net beneficiary is a family of about two people making about $27,000 per year in market income.

However the case for open borders is weaker to the extent that global transfers (such as might occur with a regional basic income or global basic income) address the economic inequities and motives for migration.

If constraints other than fiscal neutrality are considered, such as the implied top marginal tax rate or the effect on female labour supply, the picture changes: unconditional policies remain optimal and feasible in Denmark and the United Kingdom; while in Italy and Portugal universal policies appear instead to be too costly in implied top marginal tax rates and adverse effects on female participation  conditional policies such as Work Fare emerge as more desirable there.",https://doi.org/10.2202/1932-0183.1162,Alternative Basic Income Mechanisms: An Evaluation Exercise With a Microeconometric Model

The remedy against waves of unemployment does not come from an unconditional basic income. From a political philosophy perspective, paying everyone might make sense, but the practical arguments seem to be missing. The problem with the argument for paying everyone is also that it rests on a confusion between an unconditional right to an income and a right to an unconditional income. The same goes for PI. Excluding a minor part of the population from receiving participation income would be a nightmarish endeavour with unsustainable administrative costs. A revised PI model is based on the idea that universality is not a necessity for a future social assistance scheme, while individuality is. In line with the findings from basic income experiments, it is argued that conditionality is not harmful and that a participation condition can be implemented.

The South African government implemented the free basic water (FBW) policy in July 2001 to ensure all South Africans had access to a basic amount of safe water by 2004. The FBW policy entitles all people to a free lifeline supply of 6000 ls/6 kilolitres (kl) (1 kl = 1000 l) of water per household per month.

The FBW allocation does not meet the basic water requirements and special water requirements of the majority of low-income households. Low-income households require more than the 6 kl allocation and are thereby expected to pay the full cost for their water service.

It begins by analyzing the possibility of high income taxes, demonstrating that high taxes have successfully been used in many countries throughout the 20th century. The two most prominent obstacles to successfully imposing income taxes on the rich are avoidance and emigration. Yet the evidence shows that both of these obstacles can be overcome through careful policy design. The chapter then considers the major labor market reforms that could reduce income inequality, such as fostering unions, enacting full employment, increasing access to quality educational opportunities, establishing minimum wages, and reducing CEO pay. Finally, the chapter points to a number of complementary strategies for reducing inequality: the reduction of monopolies, housing support, universal child care, basic income, and the democratization of the firm.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197670392.003.0002,Is It Feasible to Reduce Inequality?

Comparing labor supply and distributional results of the budget neutral alternatives, the well-known equity-efficiency trade-off is unveiled.

In this paper I critically assess Van Parijs's proposal for a citizens' unconditional basic income. I develop three Rawlsian objections which cast doubt on the idea that Van Parijs's proposal can play a foundational role in a viable theory of social justice.

While Piketty deems Marx’s theory overly simplistic, Piketty’s contention that modern democratic nation-states should confront the problem of increasing economic inequality exaggerates governments’ ability to regulate the economy today.

First, I will examine some of the ad hoc arguments of fairness and efficiency which have been made by proponents of a consumption base and will point out the unpersuasiveness of such arguments when the primacy question of justice has not been addressed. Next, I will show that while true utilitarians would acknowledge the primacy of justice, utilitarianism is no more persuasive than ad hoc maxims with respect to questions of justice. Next, I will explain how the relative merits of competing principles of social justice can be meaningfully debated by non-philosophers within the framework for comparative philosophical analysis developed by John Rawls. I will then examine the principles of social justice described by John Rawls and explain both the purpose that an income tax plays in a society structured in accordance with these principles and the definition of income that should be adopted by a society so structured. I will then consider the purpose of the income tax and the indicated definition of income under a libertarian theory of justice. Finally, I will illustrate the use of the Rawlsian framework for comparative philosophical analysis by examining how libertarian principles of justice might be derived and justified.",,"Rawls, Justice, and the Income Tax"

And yet, since December 2010, all Iranians residing in the country have been entitled to, and nearly all receive, a monthly cash transfer of Rl 455,000 (about $45)1 per person from the government. These unconditional transfers are officially known as “cash subsidies,” since they replace price subsidies that are being phased out. The scheme falls short of a basic income as commonly conceived in the literature, but it comes far closer to it than any other large-scale cash transfer scheme in the world. It is in effect a de facto basic income that is unique not only in its scope and size, but also in its provenance and prospects. Indeed, as a potential model for replication, it may claim certain advantages over some alternative pathways to a basic income, not least the fact that it is already in place as it approaches its first anniversary.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137045300_16,Iran: A Bumpy Road toward Basic Income

The ‘basic human needs’ approach to development emphasises on providing basic material needs to people. Though, it is well acknowledged that poverty manifests in numerous dimensions, its assessment in consideration of multiple dimensions is yet to attain consensus. It is also known that as each dimension of ‘basic human needs’ has its own characteristics, it thus requires different policy intervention. Therefore, it is much more rewarding to assess the individual dimension of deprivation rather than being in the quest of an aggregate measure which will be at the cost of adequacy and simplicity.

In particular he argues that a policy of Basic Capital grants should be included in this toolkit along with a variety of other more familiar instruments such as unconditional Basic Income, welfare state services and income supports, and support for worker cooperatives. The various policies in the egalitarian toolkit, however, have implications for issues other than contributing to a more just economic system. In particular, they have implications for the long term stability, transformation, or even transcendence, of capitalism as an economic system. In this article I will argue that unconditional Basic Income has a greater potential to erode capitalism than does Basic Capital. While both of these policies in the egalitarian toolkit may make the economic system statically more just, over time Basic Capital grants are likely to strengthen capitalism as the core structure of the economic system, whereas unconditional Basic Income has the potential to erode the dominance of capitalism.

It also studies their asset decumulation patterns and some demographic characteristics. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS), this study combines both income and expenditure data to gain a more complete picture of the retirement income adequacy of current retirees. The key findings include the following: For all age groups above 65, Social Security remains the primary source of income. In 2009, households ages 65-74 and households with members age 85 or above received 54 percent and 66 percent of their total household incomes, respectively, from Social Security benefits. The importance of Social Security income increases with age. For households that had members ages 65-69 in 2001, the share of household income derived from Social Security rose from 47 percent in 2001 to almost 60 percent in 2009. Income from pensions and annuities is the second-largest source of income for older households. In 2009, households ages 65-74 received 17.1 percent and households above age 85 received 15.3 percent of their incomes from pensions and annuities. In 2009, two-fifths of households with members age 65 and above had incomes less than their expenditures -- meaning they had deficits. In 2009, 14.3 percent of households with members age 65 and above had spending that exceeded 75 percent of their household incomes. Households that face income shortfalls not only have much lower levels of assets, they spend down their liquid assets at a faster rate than households with no income shortfalls. The probability of running into an income shortfall is much higher for those with lower incomes. In 2009, 66.4 percent of households age 65 or older in the bottom-income quartile faced income deficits, while only 6.8 percent in the top-income quartile faced such shortfalls. Median home- and health-related expenses, as well as median total expenses, are much higher for households that face income shortfalls, even if they have lower levels of income.

The Canada and Quebec Pension Plans (C/QPP) were implemented in 1966 and the first cohort to receive full C/QPP benefits turned 65 in 1976. Cohorts retiring after this period were also the beneficiaries of the expansion of private occupational pensions that took place between the 1950s and the 1970s. The author relies on a detailed decomposition of income by source to show that not only did the maturation of these earnings-related programs produce a substantial increase in average real incomes but also to a substantial reduction in income inequality among the elderly, due mainly to C/QPP benefits.

Status freedom concerns the distinction between a free person and an unfree person. Continuous freedom concerns the continuum of liberties that make a person more or less free, whether they affect her status as a free person or not. Part One defines a status freedom as effective control self-ownership - the effective power to have and to refuse active cooperation with other willing people. It argues why this concept of freedom is important, situates it among the recent theories of freedom, and examines the conditions necessary to secure it. It concludes that a free person requires at least some unconditional access to property and that basic income is one way to secure that access. Part Two considers what kind of property-rights regime provides the greatest freedom in the continuous sense. It argues that Lockean and right-libertarian property theories fail to establish that full liberal ownership rights are consistent with the greatest freedom for all. It concludes that a payment from property owners to the propertyless in the form of an unconditional basic income from is necessary to establish property rights consistently with maximal equal freedom.

Coase famously addressed the problem of externalities—actions of business firms that have harmful effects on others—or, as he renamed it, “the problem of social cost.” This Article seeks to address this problem through a comparative analysis of the alternative institutional solutions of ownership, market, taxation, responsibility, and the accounting system of the joint entity. Each prospective solution carries a distinct strategy. The ownership solution involves the allocation, by law, of control rights that individuals can bargain for. The market solution, in contrast, involves the allocation of that right through a competitive auction. Taxation requires the establishment of a public order concerned with the power to fix and raise taxes, whereas the responsibility solution involves the enforcement of a compensation claim or liability for tort damages. Finally, the entity solution consists of a joint system of governance that is characterized by an accounting system of the joint activity under scrutiny. Coase claims that the delimitation of property rights is, in and of itself, sufficient to achieve social welfare. But Coase bases this claim on an efficiency criterion that looks solely to the sum of individual welfares, without regard to the possibility of inequitable results. His approach confounds notions of social cost, incurred loss, and lost opportunity gain, and faces distinctive accounting problems with individual availability and capacity to pay, along with the incommensurability of values.

Available studies show that the net direct impact of such programmes on unemployment rates and on beneficiaries' incomes is in most cases relatively low. Nevertheless, in some cases they have helped to lower levels of unemployment and poverty, and have indirect positive effects that are more difficult to measure, such as incentives to economic recovery resulting from the chain effect on consumption of beneficiaries buying goods.

However, research on the individual and institutional determinants of UBI support is scarce. The present study attempts to fills this gap by analysing workers’ attitudes towards UBI schemes in 21 European welfare states and focusing on the roles of precarious work (i.e. part-time work, temporary employment, low-skilled service employment, and solo self-employment) and unemployment benefit generosity (i.e. net replacement rate, payment duration, and qualifying period). We estimate fixed and random effects logistic models by merging country-level institutional data with the European Social Survey Round 8 data collected in 2016. The findings show that temporary employment is associated with positive attitudes towards UBI schemes, whereas other types of precarious work do not have significant influences. In addition, the results reveal that the more generous a country’s unemployment benefits, the less likely are workers in that country to support UBI schemes.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279420000185,"Precarious Work, Unemployment Benefit Generosity and Universal Basic Income Preferences: A Multilevel Study on 21 European Countries"
-22.616152,20.654331,2,"The article describes development of the idea of unconditional basic income in some Nordic countries. There were active discussions in the early 1980s and in 1992&ndash;1994 in Denmark and experiment was conducted on the introduction of unconditional basic income in Finland in 2017&ndash;2018. Basic income has never been seriously considered in Denmark on a practical level. For the first time, interest in basic income arose in Denmark in the 1980s. Once again, the issue of basic income was on the official policy agenda in 1992&ndash;1994, when there was extensive discussion on this issue. In many ways, these debates were associated with the development of the system of unemployment benefits in the country at that time and a number of economic, institutional and political circumstances. The idea of basic income was considered as a fatal blow, either too controversial or unrealistic, showing that it would require considerable money. Thus, by the mid-1990s, this idea was categorically rejected and disappeared forever from the agenda in Denmark. The unconditional basic income in Finland has been discussed for the last 10 years. It was believed that due to the mass robotization and the introduction of artificial intelligence, a huge number of people would lose their jobs in the future, and the universal basic income will force people to accept temporary contract work which ultimately will increase labor mobility and efficiency. By the classical definition unconditional basic income is the regular payment of a certain amount of money to each member of the community without checking the financial situation or the need to do work. The experiment with unconditional basic income in Finland did not fully meet this definition. First, only the unemployed could take part in it. Secondly, the experiment participants continued to receive benefits from other support systems. The authorities decided to focus on the unemployed in order to understand whether unconditional basic income encourages employment. The 2 000 citizens selected by lottery were unemployed, poor, and were between the ages of 25 and 58 years old. They received 560 euros per month, while the payment did not stop even after they found a job. Intermediate results of the experiment were almost completely opposite to the expected. Requests of recipients of basic income to the labor market have only increased. They said they were not ready to grab any job, and made more and more demands. Both for employers and for trade unions such an outcome was an unpleasant surprise. The preliminary results of the experiment with an unconditional basic income showed that in the first year participants in the experiment were looking for a little more actively than other unemployed people. Although the Finnish authorities did not officially comment on anything, all the experts said that the two-year tests showed the project&rsquo;s inconsistency. First, the &ldquo;free&rdquo; money was in fact an unconditional unemployment benefit, that is, there was nothing new in the proposed version of the universal basic income. Secondly, the government did not conceal that the experiment with the basic income was not aimed at reducing the number of the poor or fighting inequality &ndash; its main task was &ldquo;promoting employment&rdquo;. If all citizens received unconditional basic income, additional social spending would be about 5% of GDP. This is a lot, even taking into account the fact that Finland spends about 30% of GDP on social spending. A universal basic income can only be successful if provided on a continuous and universal basis. But it requires a lot of money and higher taxes which most people disagree with.",https://doi.org/10.20542/0131-2227-2020-64-9-48-52,Basic Income in Some Nordic Countries: Theory and Practice
26.754103,12.699584,4,"This article offers a conceptual model of how resources, including time and human and social capital, interact with responsibilities, including personal care, childcare and other unpaid work, to produce a range of feasible time allocations. Each allocation generates a combination of disposable income and free time. This set of feasible income—time combinations provides a measure of the individual’s capability set or his/her substantive freedom. The approach is illustrated empirically with data and simulations based on the UK Time Use Survey 2000. The results show that having low educational qualifications (reflecting limited command over resources), having more or younger children (implying greater caring responsibilities), being single and being disabled (both of which adversely affect the rate at which resources can be converted into valuable outcomes) are each independently associated with having a small capability set, defined in terms of the level and range of combinations of disposable income and free time that can be achieved. The paper concludes that the range of combinations of disposable income and free time that a person can achieve provides a useful metric for assessing inequality in individuals’ substantive freedom to pursue their goals in life — a key target for liberal egalitarians.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463x10369754,"Time, income and substantive freedom: A capability approach"

Design/methodology/approach The first section reviews the recent success of AI in outperforming humans in cognitive intense activities such as Go, poker and other strategic games, which portends a shift in comparative advantage in human brain power work to machines. It notes the potential for a portfolio of specialized computer algorithms to compete with human general intelligence in work. The analysis contributes to the debate between economists dubious about claims that AI robotics will disrupt work and futurists who expect many jobs to be fully automated in coming years. It advances three “laws of robo-economics” to guide thinking about the new technologies and presents evidence that growing robot intensity has begun to impact the job market. Findings The paper finds that the case for AI robotics substantially changing the world of work and the distribution of income is more compelling than the case that it will have similar impacts on wages and employment as past technological changes. It advances an ownership solution to spread the benefits of AI robot-driven automation widely. Originality/value To the extent that who owns the robots rules the world, it argues for a concerted social effort to widen the “who” in ownership from the few to the many. It reviews policies to expand employee ownership of their own firm and of the stream of revenue via profit-sharing and gain-sharing bonuses. But the paper notes that ensuring that growth of AI robotics benefits all through ownership will require expansion of workers’ and citizens’ stake in business broadly, through collective investment via pension funds, individual investment in mutual funds and development of sovereign wealth funds.",https://doi.org/10.1108/jpeo-04-2018-0015,Ownership when AI robots do more of the work and earn more of the income

Inspired by Veblen (1899), this paper considers a two-type optimal income tax model, where people care about their relative consumption, and where the importance of relative consumption increases with the use of leisure due to increased consumption visibility. We show that increased consumption positionality typically implies higher marginal income tax rates for both ability-types. Using a leisure-weighted measure of reference consumption, rather than a measure where leisure plays no role as in the previous literature, increases the marginal income tax rate implemented for the low-ability type and decreases the marginal income tax rate implemented for the high-ability type, i.e., it gives rise to a regressive tax component.",,Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class Revisited: Implications for Optimal Income Taxation

Simulations based on a micro-econometric labor supply model show that this could add to the workforce an additional number of 800,000 workers.

16.902557,-14.718082,4,"Abstract Automation is a big concern in modern societies in view of its widespread impact on many socioeconomic issues including income, jobs, and productivity. While previous studies have concentrated on determining the effects on jobs and salaries, our aim is to understand how automation affects productivity, and how some policies, such as taxes on robots or universal basic income, moderate or aggravate those effects. To this end, we have designed an experiment where workers make productive effort decisions, and managers can choose between workers and robots to do these tasks. In our baseline treatment, we measure the effort made by workers who may be replaced by robots, and also elicit firm replacement decisions. Subsequently, we carry out treatments in which workers have a universal basic income of about a fifth of the workers’ median wages, or where there is a tax levy on firms who replace workers by robots. We complete the picture of the impact of automation by looking into the coexistence of workers and robots with part-time jobs. We find that the threat of a robot substitution does not affect the amount of effort exerted by workers. Also, neither universal basic income nor a tax on robots decrease workers’ effort. We observe that the robot substitution tax reduces the probability of worker substitution. Finally, workers that benefit from managerial decisions to not substitute them by more productive robots do not increase their effort level. Our conclusions shed light on the interplay of policy and workers behavior under pervasive automation.",https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-00676-8,"Robots, labor markets, and universal basic income"
34.961857,-12.720805,4,"Only one in four eligible households receives some form of rental assistance from the federal government. Nonetheless, there is no time limit for the receipt of this assistance; individuals can continue to receive benefits as long as they satisfy eligibility requirements. In addition, individuals who do obtain assistance frequently have higher incomes than those denied it. Beyond simply providing housing, federal rental assistance is enlisted to serve a myriad of additional policy goals — including furthering economic integration and providing access to better neighborhoods — that can exacerbate inequities between those who receive benefits and those denied assistance. These broader objectives often increase the cost of housing assistance and reduce the number of households served. Given increasingly limited resources and the growing demand for rental assistance, difficult decisions must be made regarding how to satisfy a range of conflicting programmatic goals. Although for at least four decades legal scholars, economists, public policy experts, and politicians have denounced the inequities in existing housing policy, no one has provided a detailed analysis of the specific ways in which this policy departs from norms of distributive justice and of how it might be made more equitable. This Article moves the conversation beyond simply decrying existing inequities and instead carefully analyzes federal housing policy in light of specific theories of distributive justice. Drawing on the philosophical literature, it evaluates the specifics of existing policies, and their distributional impacts, in light of five theories of distributive justice. It then proposes a new structure for federal rental assistance, which would allow recipients to choose among a set of “housing resource bundles.” This approach will not only satisfy the most salient understandings of distributive justice, but will also advance the concerns that underpin other distributive justice theories and allow federal housing policy to more effectively embrace a plurality of programmatic goals.",,Housing Resource Bundles: Distributive Justice and Federal Low-Income Housing Policy

In return, they are promised eternal bliss and everlasting happiness in the life to come.

-0.9540503,-28.635818,0,"The Canadian personal income tax system does not pay much attention to whether the amount of money an individual brings home is supplemented by the income of a spouse or not. That means that families where one spouse earns more than the other get taxed at a higher rate than families where two working partners earn the same total income split evenly between two paycheques. In fact, a family with just a single earner making $70,000 a year pays 30 per cent more in taxes every year than a family with two partners making $35,000 a year. A single-earner family taking in $120,000 a year pays the same income tax as a dualearning couple making $141,000 between them. The federal Conservative government has at least suggested it wants to finally level that playing field — nearly six decades after a royal commission recommended that the income tax system be changed to recognize total family household income, rather than focusing on each individual’s income. Given that Canada’s income tax system aims to treat people in similar circumstances as equally as possible, it is certainly time to let couples split their income so they do not face a penalty in higher tax rates than those faced by couples bringing home the same amount of total pay. While couples with just a single earner enjoy some advantages, a dual-earning couple does not — namely the extra time the stay-at-home spouse is able to use to raise children and produce other unpaid, home-based benefits — that can be accounted for using other means. Specifically, cutting out the transferability of the unused portion of the basic personal tax exemption for couples splitting income — requiring couples splitting their income to each earn money in order to use this credit — is one way to account for the difference in unpaid benefits that single-income families do typically enjoy more than dual-income couples. That is one mechanism; there may still be others the government might consider. But the bottom line is that there are ways to account for certain non-labour-market-related differences between single-earner families and dual-earner families.

The importance of upstream health determinants suggests that basic income could improve health and reduce health inequalities. Since the effects of a universal, permanent basic income would differ from those of a trial, extrapolation of impacts from existing evidence is difficult. However, studies of interventions that unconditionally provide substantial, regular payments to individuals or families can provide insights into the potential effects. We conducted a scoping review to identify and synthesise evidence that could inform the planning stage of potential basic income pilots in Scotland.       Methods   We searched eight bibliographic and eight specialist databases for articles published in English from database inception until April, 2017 (initial searches), and November, 2017 (later iteration). We included randomised controlled trials, quasi-experiments, qualitative studies, and controlled before–after studies reporting any outcome of unconditional payments for low-income people or the general population. Studies conducted in low-income countries were excluded. Initial searches indicated that there were important studies of other interventions, so relevant search terms were incorporated in further iterative searches. Results were screened by one reviewer and a second reviewer checked a 10% sample. Data were charted and thematically analysed, following recognised scoping review approaches.       Findings   From 1591 papers identified, we included 28 studies of ten interventions implemented in a range of contexts that used various evaluation methods. The interventions were heterogeneous, but some were universal and permanent, and all provided substantial, regular payments unconditionally. Studies measured effects on employment, health, education, crime, and other social outcomes. Evidence on health impacts was mixed, with some studies finding strong positive impacts on outcomes such as birthweight and mental health, whereas others reported no effect. There was some evidence that effects were stronger in more at-risk groups. Most studies reported little impact on labour market participation.       Interpretation   Fears of a large decrease in labour market participation due to basic income seem to be unfounded, but inference was often hampered by small samples or multiple intervention arms.

31.769794,6.534969,4,"Introduction   Decades of research unequivocally demonstrates that no matter the society, socioeconomic resources are perhaps the most fundamental determinants of health throughout the life course, including during its very earliest stages. As a result, societies have implemented ‘cash transfer’ programmes, whichprovide income supplementation to reduce socioeconomic disadvantage among the poorest families with young children. Despite this being a common approach of societies around the world, research on effects of these programmes in low-income/middle-income countries, and those in high-income countries has been conducted as if they are entirely distinct phenomena. In this paper, we systematically review the international literature on the association between cash transfer programmes and health outcomes during the first year of life.   Methods   We conducted a systematic review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol.

Less explored are the patterns and mechanisms through which perceived work disincentives shape public attitudes toward such programs. The present article bridges this gap by examining how individuals' exposure to a moral hazard discourse affects their support for an income transfer program. Our original survey experiment in South Korea finds that the effect of an identically worded piece of moral hazard information plays out differently depending on the eligibility criteria of the program in question (means‐tested vs. universal) and the economic status of the respondents. The findings have significant implications for understanding the support base for the welfare state in the context of resurging interest in basic/guaranteed income.,https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12386,Work disincentive perceptions and welfare state attitudes: A survey experiment in South Korea
28.861696,-20.743065,0,"It has been established that relatively high income families receive a disproportionately large share of UI benefits. Little information on the distribution of costs by income class is available, but it is quite possible that the upper income groups may also bear a disproportionately large share of the costs. More empirical research is needed before the redistributive effects of UI can be known with any degree of confidence. There is little argument about the desirability on income mainlenance grounds of extending Unemployment insurance benefits in a recessionary period, all other things being equal. U1 is quite efficient as an income maintenance tool for covered workers. With respect to the unemployment problem, though, it is feared by some that the program goes too far in maintaining the incomes of covered workers, and as a result any extension of UI benefits will aggravate the unemployment problem. The evidence presented here suggests that fears of a major increase in unemployment as a result of such changes are largely unwarranted. However, extended UI benefits would appear to have some small, nontrivial adverse impact on unemployment. Finally, it seems that UI's income distributional impact has been portrayed unjustly as pro-rich. It may be that income is transferred through the UI system from the relatively well-to-do to the relatively poor. There is no scientific way of bringing these considerations to bear in deciding whether or not to restructure the unemployment insurance system.

Design/methodology/approach The idea that everyone should receive a set amount of money regardless of employment finds renewed momentum amid increasingly precarious work arrangements and an uncertain job market. Less explored, however, is the connection between this idea and the more established notion of universal healthcare. This paper brings these two ideas together by examining their shared underpinnings in capitalist work relations, and more broadly a global economic system organized by and for corporations at the expense of workers. Findings The argument is made that the underlying dynamics of contemporary capitalism cannot be relied upon to provide for basic health and wealth. These limitations must be offset with social assurances that not only mitigate capitalism’s liabilities, but also facilitate innovation and sustainable growth.

While workplace flexibility and the unconditional basic income (UBI) both offer prospects for greater freedom and justice, they also harbor the risk of shoring up the work society. To avert this danger, we must therefore reconfigure the value and place of paid work in our lives. Moreover, we need to rethink the meaning of community at a deeper level, and in particular, abandon the view that community is constructed by work, whether paid or not. This task raises significant challenges, but Jean-Luc Nancy’s work on the “inoperative community” provides key philosophical guidance. Since the relational ontology of this alternative view of community stands in stark tension with capitalism, a liberal-reformist approach to lessening the burden of paid work that fails to tackle the underlying economic and social structure offers only limited gains in terms of freedom and justice. Moving beyond the work society and more fully realizing freedom and justice therefore entails nothing short of a new conception of community and the struggle against capitalism.",https://doi.org/10.7591/cornell/9781501714863.001.0001,"Undoing Work, Rethinking Community"

A public debate has ensued about the form that new or reformed cash transfers might take. While debating, we have introduced changes in our cash-transfer system, especially in the means-tested sector, without having explicitly chosen to take the direction which these changes imply. Thus, the changes that we have already adopted warrant serious re-examination. This article discusses two of the issues in doubt. In some states we have already assured benefit levels in public assistance at or near the poverty line and have added an incentive scheme to this guarantee. We justify this policy by our faith that ""add-on"" will lead to ""take-off."" This change in policy, however, is more likely to lead to the curious outcome that families are likely to be better off economically when they are both at work and on welfare. To avoid this dilemma, we need a wage-level policy which seeks to raise the wages in the marginal low-wage economy and to make it an alternative, rather than a supplement, to benefits. The impact which improvements in low wages would have on the rest of the economy is a critical issue, characterized more by passion than by understanding.

-19.740868,39.29523,3,"Universal Basic Income (UBI) is   concept that has recently begun to enter the popular political consciousness in the United States. It is defined as a regular cash income paid to all, on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It is invoked for   wide variety of political and social purposes, but is almost always presented as radically different from existing governmental welfare and transfer systems. Once   UBI is disaggregated into discrete policy components, it is possible to imagine to what degree existing programs share the benefits (and detriments) of   UBI to   greater or lesser degree, and reforms could be made to make existing programs more UBI-like, if that would be beneficial. 

This Article re-envisions   UBI as   series of reforms to one of the largest existing governmental transfer program in the US: the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is   work-conditional transfer program, and so any UBI-like reforms to the EITC will lack the defining characteristic of   UBI - that is it not work conditional. On the other hand,   number of reforms to the EITC would make the program more UBI-like. These include: (i) that the EITC phaseout be removed so the program is no longer means-tested (no means testing); (ii) that the program benefit be applied on an individual basis, decreasing the importance of support of custodial children (individuality); (iii) that the administration of the program be reformed so workers can receive payments throughout the year (regularity). By starting with the EITC and proposing   series of reforms to make it more UBI-like, one is able to accurately assess the differences between   UBI and at least one large governmental transfer program, diminishing the impression that   UBI is too utopian to actually become reality. One is further able to build on decades of tax policy research about the successes and failings of the EITC.

Of particular importance to both supporters and critics of the UBI is its lack of work requirement, and that is often its most philosophically controversial element. By exploring UBI-like reforms to the EITC (which is work conditional), this paper relaxes   defining aspect of the UBI - that it be free from work requirements. For some supporters, this makes any comparison between the program proposed and   UBI nonsensical. But the EITC is already more like   UBI than many work-conditional transfer programs, and reforms could make its work-conditionality even less problematic. Still, maintaining the EITC's structure as   work-conditional transfer program distinguishes it dramatically from   true UBI, and loses   number of the central benefits of   UBI. It is the premise of this paper that an exploration of   partial UBI of this nature -   compromise - is useful for future discussion of the issue, even if the proposed program is   distinct second best. It is not   coincidence that Senator Kamala Harris,   contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has proposed   UBI-like program, the LIFT the Middle Class Act, which shares many of the features of the reforms proposed in this Article.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3338468,EITC For All: A Universal Basic Income Compromise Proposal

We augment these building blocks with a mechanism that allows the community to maintain sovereignty over the economy, by making it sybil-resilient. To do so, we assume that the community has the means for exposing sybils and we extend the basic egalitarian currency digital social contract with means to balance the economy so that money minted by sybils is eventually retrieved and burned. This leads---asymptotically---to distributive justice among the genuine agents, with the amount of money minted being equal to the number of genuine agents, multiplied by the time each agent was a member of the community.

Rather, society should certainly respect the “social freedom” of the basic rights, and secure some kind of efficient equal freedom of choice in domains of choice which are necessarily non-identical. The various ways of specifying this principle lead to the same distributive structure of ELIE – equal labour income equalization –, which also amounts to an equal tax credit (or basic income) financed by an equal labour of all – or by a flat tax exempting overtime labour –; to each individual yielding to each other the proceeds of the same labour; and to a number of other highly meaningful properties. This scheme is incentive-compatible, implies a minimum income, and satisfies realistic no-envy. It applies to multidimensional labour and extends to situations of unemployment.

30.748283,-12.458166,4,"This paper is focused on a specific reform strategy - the Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI).It addresses an age-old issue of social welfare programming in a market economy. How do we maintain an incentive to work yet provide a safety net for those shaken loose by large-scale yet seemingly continuous change? Why participate in a losing cause if the consequences of not participating are not all that bad materially? The problem is particularly acute when the financial rewards of work and the type of work available both continue to deteriorate for a very broad class of people, as is happening in Canada. Even worse, how does one prevent the development of a welfare culture that is tolerated, if not totally accepted, to the point that it becomes immune to moral suasion from the broader community? The Guaranteed Annual Income concept has been debated for some time in academic circles and widely discussed in a larger public policy circle. This paper briefly documents the various public reviews of the concept in Canada over the past 25 years. It details the major benefit of a GAI, principally in terms of reducing the disincentive to work in the current program. It also outlines the downside of a potentially much more expensive program as benefits are spread across a larger population of working poor. The paper demonstrates that a modest federal GAl is financially viable even in the current context of fiscal restraint. Ample monies could be found from a reform of the Unemployment Insurance program by reducing eligibility, reducing benefits, and moving to experience-rated premiums for employers. These reforms would reduce the program's considerable income redistribution between regions, individuals, families, and employers. The result would be a program that is more clearly an insurance program against the adverse consequences of short-term unemployment. The paper’s estimates of savings and costs are slightly dated now because of government changes since the paper was written, but the general point remains intact. As noted, even in administrative terms, the federal government has already gone a substantial way in its tax structure toward being able to implement a GAl. Moreover, under such a program the federal government would work directly with low-income people. In the most cost-effective manner, that is, by sending money. In doing so, it would also have the opportunity to maintain its profile in the broader community. This would leave the provinces, and through them the municipalities and other agencies, free to deal more closely with those needing other forms of assistance. Inevitably these will be more selective, and therefore more information intensive and probably more labour intensive. That is as it should be if these governments are to pursue their respective competitive advantages.",,Income Security Reform and the Concept of a Guaranteed Annual Income

Although the discussion about basic income has a long tradition within the literature of political philosophy, van Parijs’ contribution is regarded as the most systematic work in this area. Following his line of reasoning, an UBI is the consequence of the claim to increase real freedom of the least-advantaged members of society while remaining neutral to their different life plans. While discussing van Parijs’ claim of an UBI to maximize real freedom, the focus shifts to Dworkin’s approach to resource egalitarianism that is central to this claim. It relies on a distribution of resources that is both ambition-sensitive and endowment-insensitive. Afterwards, ways of financing an UBI are studied from a normative perspective and the operationalization of this concept is discussed.

This book focuses on an important and novel feature of these programmes: they replace the rights-based entitlements that have characterized the welfare state for decades with conditional rights dependent on the fulfilment of obligations: conditions are attached to the benefits received. This new type of social contract between the claimant and the State carries with it a new construction of the relationship between rights and responsibilities, and a new interpretation of citizenship. Paz-Fuchs examines the theoretical underpinnings of welfare-to-work programmes, incorporating a comparative analysis of the UK and USA, where the ideal of social citizenship is being curtailed through welfare reforms. He argues that when the rhetoric of the social contract is used to imply a continuous contract between citizens and the state, a vast array of conditions on welfare can be legitimated, including workfare; the obligation to accept any job offer; and moral and social preconditions that are based on a vague notion of reciprocity. Paz-Fuchs argues, by contrast, that conditional welfare undermines civil rights such as the right to privacy and family life by requiring welfare claimants to change their behaviour.

In the second part, we show that the cost of income security programs must essentially be related to the amount of ""net transfers"". As a consequence, GAI programs will be costlier than the present system, because they require greater net transfers. In the third part, given a distribution of families by level of income, we show that the rate of decrease of poverty through any GAI program depends on the relative values of both the arbitrarily chosen poverty threshold and on the selected breaking point of ""zero net transfer"".

1.3351885,-31.664034,2,"In this chapter, different approaches for the specification of reference income levels in the income stabilization tool (IST) are analyzed. The current proposal of the European Commission suggests a 3-year average or a 5-year Olympic average to specify the farm-level reference income that is used to identify if and to what extent a farmer is indemnified in a specific year. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the impact of income trends on indemnification if these average-based methods are used in the IST. In addition, we propose and investigate a regression-based approach that considers observed income trends to specify reference income levels. Furthermore, we apply these three different approaches to farm-level panel data from Swiss agriculture for the period 2003–2009. We find that average-based approaches cause lower than expected indemnification levels for farmers with increasing incomes, and higher indemnifications if farm incomes are decreasing over time. Small income trends are sufficient to cause substantial biases between expected (fair) and realized indemnification payments at the farm level. In the presence of income trends, average-based specifications of reference income levels will thus cause two major problems for the IST. First, differences between expected and realized indemnification levels can lead to significant mismatches between expected and real costs of the IST. Second, indemnity levels that do not reflect farm-level income losses do not allow achieving the actual purpose of the IST of securing farm incomes. Our analysis shows that a regression-based approach to specify reference income levels can contribute to bound potential biases in cases of decreasing or increasing income levels.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-06635-6_4,Alternative Specifications of Reference Income Levels in the Income Stabilization Tool

The flexibilization process started during the 1970s and continues to change the labor market and the perception of labor to the present day.

Precarity resulting from fixed-term, short-term, part-time or temporary employment can concern everyone and has negative consequences on society, economy and health. In parallel to the development of precarity, a possibility of basic security in the form of the Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) is discussed globally. However, the particular situation in Germany, regarding the precariat and the UBI as a possible solution has not been outlined yet. Although, UBI implementation models have been proposed for Germany, there is no analysis in the current literature that would show the effect of the UBI on the German precariat.

28.837345,-41.820312,0,"Why 'personal' or 'private' accounts could save the system. Social security has been one of the most successful government programs in our nation's history. Unfortunately, the basic financial structure of Social security, designed during the depths of the Great Depression, is not well equipped to handle the substantial demographic changes that are under way in the United States. As a result, Social security simply cannot afford to pay currently scheduled benefits in the coming decades without imposing an ever-larger tax burden on younger workers. In the face of this demographic and financial reality, doing nothing is simply not a viable policy option. Social security must change if it is to be made financially secure. This article outlines the basic reasons that the Social security system is in long-run financial distress and discusses the policy options namely tax increases or benefit cuts-available for closing the financial shortfalls within the confines of the existing system. Pre-funding Social security-that is, saving more today in order to reduce the burden on future generations emerges as the most sensible way to proceed, with personal retirement accounts (PRAS) constituting a mechanism for saving that is superior to the current system's reliance on trust funds. Indeed, much of the current opposition to such accounts is based on misconceptions about PEAS as part of a reformed Social security system. A TAY As You GO' SYSTEM The U.S. Social security system is not a savings program. Rather, it is an income transfer system that taxes today's workers to pay benefits for today's retirees and other beneficiaries. Economists call such a financial structure a   or unfunded system. This is in sharp contrast to die pre-funded nature of most private-sector pension plans in which the money contributed to a worker's pension is invested in real financial assets (e.g., stocks or bonds) that are then used to pay benefits when the worker begins receiving benefits. In economic terms, the primary disadvantage of a   system relative to a pre-funded system is that it reduces national saving, reduces economic growth, and therefore shrinks the size of the economic pie (Feldstein, 1974). Despite its economic disadvantages, an unfunded, pay-as-you-go system can still work reasonably well when there are a large number of workers paying taxes to support each beneficiary. Back in 1950, for example, there were sixteen workers paying taxes to support each Social security beneficiary. At that time, a payroll tax rate of only 3 percent was sufficient to support the expenditures of the entire Social security program. As the Social security system has expanded and matured, however, the ratio of workers to retirees has fallen substantially, as indicated in Figure i. Today there are only 3.3 workers to support each beneficiary. As a result of population aging, this ratio will fall to just 2 within a generation.1 To put these numbers into perspective, consider the following example. When there are sixteen workers per retiree, as was the case in 1950, then for every $100 that the government pays to the average Social security beneficiary, each worker must pay a tax of $6.25. When the worker-to-beneficiary ratio falls to 3.3, as it stands today, each worker must pay over $30 in taxes to provide a $100 benefit. As this ratio falls to 2, the tax must rise to $50 per worker. Simple mathematics dictates that as the ratio of workers-to-beneficiaries declines, Social security must either raise taxes or reduce benefits in order to keep the system in annual fiscal balance. While this example is highly stylized, the lesson is very real. Today, employees and employers pay a combined 12.4 percent in Social Security taxes on die first $87,900 in earnings. These taxes, combined with a much smaller amount of revenue obtained from personal income taxation on some Social security benefits, raised approximately $470 billion in 2003. …",,The case for pre-funding social security

In Putting Human Universal Rights to Work, Archibald Stuart, an emeritus professor of social work, intends to lay out a logical policy strategy for increasing social justice. He notes, Social justice can be a vague and abstract objective unless concepts and steps for action are defined in detail (p. 3). Stuart focuses primarily on class struggle, relegating cultural or social issues to a second tier. He shows how privatization, capitalism, and   free-market often exploit workers and prevent people from escaping poverty. He delineates traditional arguments about equality of opportunity and equality of outcome, explaining how   former is touted as   pinnacle of social justice yet in fact further alienates workers from each other. In a shrinking or stagnant economy, finding a job is a zero-sum game, so simply offering more education does little to alleviate unemployment without concurrent restructuring of   labor market. His solution rests, in large part, on   provision of social security services and government regulation. He also suggests how   economy could be improved by different fiscal policies. For example, Stuart describes how tax credits might give consumers more spending money and thereby grow   economy. Such an effort to increase   well being of a population in a state-level society would be very useful, but   book's weaknesses leave it short of this lofty goal. Repeatedly, Stuart claims he will suggest means of building support for policy actions, yet he conflates all conservatives under   rubric of a laissez-faire conservatism [which] expresses   theme that   uncontrolled private market should dominate   social and economic process and   best government is one that governs   least (p. 11). Meanwhile, he characterizes his own social liberalism as concerned with   social order and social conditions. It is based on   belief in   dignity and worth of each individual... (p. 15) as if his adversaries did not share those same beliefs. His portrayal of one side as corrupt, uncaring capitalists and   other as moral and just does not create a space for working together and fosters   very antagonism he critiques. Stuart reduces complex socio-cultural motivations to economic interests; for example, he explains,   economic decline [of   mid-1970s] threatened low-income whites who were afraid of being displaced by African Americans who sought higher education as a means of competing for scarce, good jobs. The result was a backlash against   Civil Rights Movement that led may whites to shift to   conservative Republican party (p. 8). He also links advances in civil rights to   robust economy of   post-World War II era while linking increases in social security programs to times of economic hardship. He relates   shrinkage of social services in this current time period to the growing power of conservative forces,   decline in   number of persons employed in manufacturing, and a dramatic decline in union memberships (p. ix), leaving   reader to wonder whether   introduction of social security in   Roosevelt administration was   result of a perfect storm. …",,Putting Universal Human Rights to Work: Policy Actions in the Struggle for Social Justice by Archibald Stuart

A BI is a monthly stipend paid to every adult citizen, regardless of what they decide to do with it. Research suggests a BI could grant more financial freedom and increased health amongst people. However, it could also work counterproductive, as it takes away a strong motivator to work: money. A few trials have been run in the past, knowledge on the psychological effects or attitudes of those living with a Basic Income is lacking. One way to study potential effects of BI, is called futuring. With futuring, people imagine a possible future for themselves and then respond to questions or assignments as though they are actually living that future. By imagining the future, researchers may be able to find some attitudes towards and psychological effects of a future event, like the Basic Income. This study aimed to add to the discussion and research in this subject, by using focus group discussions to study people’s attitudes towards the BI and a questionnaire studying the Time Perspective. It will look at a relationship between a person’s Time Perspective and their attitudes towards the Basic Income. To measure an individual’s Time Perspective, Zimbardo and Boyd’s (1999) Time Perspective Index (ZTPI) was used. Making use of both focus group discussions and questionnaires, this study used 14 participants to study people’s general attitudes towards the BI. Two discussion groups consisting of seven participants each were held, during which the participants were asked to imagine a future in which they received a Basic Income, and then they were invited to elaborate on the BI. Afterwards, the ZTPI questionnaire was filled in. The ZTPI exists of 56 questions, that are divided among 5 sub-scales: (1) Past Negative (PN), (2) Past Positive (PP), (3) Present Fatalistic (PF), (4) Present Hedonistic (PH), and (5) Future (F). The focus group discussions were transcribed and coded with Atlas.ti, resulting in a code scheme of 6 codes. These codes were (1) Basic Income Positive, (2) Basic Income Negative, (3) Basic Income Conditional, (4) Future (F), (4.5) Freedom to do other things, and (5) Stress Relief. The results showed that most people were fairly positive about the BI. Some people were more sceptical and had more critical questions about the BI, such as those high in the Past and Present Positive orientation. However, everyone liked the idea of BI in some shape or form, in the end. Due to a small participant group, the results can be questioned. To ensure deeper and more meaningful results, an experimental trial of the BI is recommended, as it is very difficult to predict or draw conclusions from something that lies in the future.",,"Past, Present, and Future Perspective as a Predictor for Basic Income: On the Relationship between Time Perspective on Basic Income"

-6.928958,-18.886948,0,"Summary The main claim of this paper is that in a world of equal entitlements to work rights the justification for a basic income is stronger, and that its level should be higher, the higher the level of unemployment or job scarcity. Point of departure is an economy with job scarcity. A fair way to deal with job scarcity is to grant everybody an equal right to work, where these rights can be freely traded. It turns out that such a Labour Rights scheme and a basic income scheme are equivalent. The equivalence is that the price of Labour Rights and the unemployment benefit corresponds to the income tax rate and basic income respectively. The tax rate can thus be considered as what workers have to pay to appropriate scarce job assets. Both schemes allow that some people voluntarily abstain from doing paid work, in return for a financial compensation. Therefore, the advantages in terms of equity and efficiency of a Labour Rights scheme equally apply to the basic income proposal. This analysis provides an argument against cutting unemployment and social assistance benefits during economic downturns and it offers new insights to evaluate the parasitism and exploitation objection raised against basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0770451800010800,"Basic income, unemployment and job scarcity"

We conceptualize the housing system as a system of social stratification, arguing that recent policy shifts reinforce market dynamics and do not increase access to affordable housing. Our analysis suggests market-centered programs, together with sizeable cuts in federal assistance, are shifting many low-income housing residents to the private market, resulting in economic distress for these families. We maintain that lack of access to affordable housing is fundamentally a public policy issue. We see the combination of lower levels of housing funding and increased private sector control as likely to reduce the long-standing federal commitment to housing, while exacerbating inequalities. Addressing the contradictions inherent in current housing policy could be the first step toward genuine anti-poverty policy reform and progressive change.",https://doi.org/10.1300/j134v09n02_01,"HOPE VI, Section 8, and the Contradictions of Low-Income Housing Policy"
-28.212416,-30.475948,0,"This article focuses on economic analysis of the concept of universal basic income. This social assistance scheme is regarded as an alternative to traditional targeted, means-tested, social benefits. The paper elaborates on what distinguishes universal basic income from other forms of social benefits, and analyzes some of the most widespread arguments in its favor. A hypothetical implementation of basic income could not only generate social and economic gains, but would also inevitably be associated with certain costs. In particular, given that for some individuals with medium and high incomes basic income payments would in essence be a tax deduction, taxes would need to be raised in order to balance out the state budget. This would lead to additional administration costs. As demonstrated in the article, they should be interpreted as costs of reduction of information asymmetry, which inevitably arises in the relation between the state and recipients of social assistance. It is shown that the economic side of a number of key arguments for basic income boils down to the latter making it possible to reduce information asymmetry. These arguments include the assertions that universal basic income would make the welfare system simpler and more manageable, eliminate poverty traps and expand the freedom of choice among social benefit recipients. The information asymmetry approach is applied to the analysis of preliminary results of the basic income experiment conducted in Finland in 2017–2018. The paper provides evidence that basic income is only one of the many possible approaches to reducing information asymmetry in welfare systems.",https://doi.org/10.18288/1994-5124-2019-3-80-95,Universal Basic Income and the Problem of Information Asymmetry

The tool used is an elementary cost-minimizing linear program. Its dual yields dollar values for both the agent's time andhis social requirements; it also implies a socio-economic theory of saving and impatience.

We show that, even in the neoclassical labor supply model without intrinsic work motivation, the basic income increases the participation rate in the labor market.

The idea behind the approach is that what really matters for people’s welfare in the long run is their permanentincome. The basic assumption is that people have a kind of latent long-term income-toneeds level from which occasional departures are possible due to temporary income shortfalls or income surpluses associated with the occurrence of events such as(un)employment, disability or illness, overtime work or working time reductions. According to this framework, poverty can be seen as a state in which permanent income falls below a predefined threshold being the long-term poverty line. The approach can therefore be helpful in estimating the size of the population in persistent poverty. When appropriate variables are added to the empirical model, it is possible to monitor the effect of socio-economic events on the permanent income-to-needs level. Following Esping-Andersen’s seminal work on welfare-state regimes, one might perceive the UK as a liberal welfare state although in a less prototypical sense as it exists in the US. Germany should clearly be considered to belong to the corporatist prototype and the Netherlands to the social-democratic type. Then, presumably, the UK has the lowest permanent income-to-needs level, the highest persistent poverty incidence and the highest income mobility. The findings confirm the presumption that permanent income is lower in a liberal welfare state as the UK although not very much lower than in the other countries. Hence, the transitory part of income is slightly larger in this liberal type of welfare state. The results also show that permanent income is more unequally distributed in the UK than in the Netherlands and Germany and that income inequalities have a less permanent character in the Netherlands. Besides, transitory shocks in income have a less permanent effect in the Netherlands than in the two other countries. The inclusion of household composition or labour market variables does not alter the main results. Viewing the effect of labour market status variables, like living in a household with a not working head, it is shown that members of these households are more likely persistent poor, particularly when the head is female. The effects of household structure on persistent poverty appear quite large. Especially, lone-parents households seem prone to persistent poverty in all three welfare regimes but single elderly particularly in the UK.",,"Persistent poverty in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK"

Much of this work involves developing an account of what the fair allocation of educational resources ought to look like under ideal conditions. However, recent developments in competitive global capitalism, including the protracted nature of the global recession, have called the feasibility of such accounts into question. Austerity policies have developed to the extent to which the idea of social goods as public and sharable – and so the very concept of distributive justice – has been called into question. Accordingly, what kind of conceptual resources can liberal theory offer to actual citizens working for educational justice under austerity as a public policy?

Specifically, I analyze and compare reforms that aim to redistribute by targeting benefits at low-income individuals through an income or means test, versus those that emphasize “universal” allocation of benefits, not conditioned on poverty. I argue that notwithstanding that we should expect universal provision (by definition) to achieve less redistribution than means testing, universalist policies ultimately may be more effective in achieving this goal because they are likely to be more politically durable, and - more intriguingly - to create social conditions that increase toleration for redistribution. I support this argument by drawing upon the growing body of research in psychology and economics suggesting that people have a mixture of self-regarding and other-regarding impulses, and that some forms of social organization are more likely than others to elicit pro-social behavior. Universalist programs, I argue, plausibly increase preferences for redistribution by tapping social norms of reciprocity, generating group identity effects based on a sense of common vulnerability, and serving as a “policy frame” that de-emphasizes the salience of low-income people as an undeserving “out-group.” I use a case study of recent social insurance legislation as a springboard for developing an empirical research agenda that would help evaluate the strength of my thesis.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1461098,"Can Joe the Plumber Support Redistribution?

Our results confirm this observation but we also find that the data offer an alternative interpretation of what the Hungarian welfare state is actually doing. Instead of supporting the poor it reallocates resources from the working age population to children and elderly people. It functions as an intermediary between overlapping generations that seek to finance their lifecycle by exploiting the opportunity offered by the very overlap, the fact that contemporaries are of different age. In a cross-sectional framework we analyse reallocations by age and income simultaneously and assess the relative importance of these two variables in explaining the access and contribution to public benefits. Our data from 2010 (based on EU-SILC and the Household Budget Survey) covers public transfers (cash and in-kind) and both direct and indirect taxes. We compare the importance of age and income in explaining transfers and taxes in a regression-analysis framework by studying causal importance (comparing coefficients) and dispersion importance of the variables (using Shapley-value decomposition). We find that income is irrelevant in explaining access to benefits and services but age is important. On the contribution side, income proves as important as age.

The latter also introduced RMI, a minimum income to support the poorest, taking the IGF as its funding source. The wealthy who opposed the wealth tax could not strongly resist the tax due to public opinions and pursued tax rationalization. Conflicts over RMI persisted. Both left and right wings were in favor of this system, but their intentions and purposes were different. The left wing emphasized that RMI is a support for the minimum life of the poor. The right, on the other hand, demanded active incorporation of the beneficiaries of RMI into the labor market so that they would not be overly dependent on welfare.

-11.225034,-32.48185,0,"Today’s welfare states consist of multifarious instruments and provisions for the social protection of people, whereby differences exist not only between countries, but also between programs (e.g., unemployment insurance, social assistance, pension systems). However, these complex welfare systems are under pressure. On the one hand, recent decades have been considered as the “silver age” in welfare state policy, characterized by the need to retrench and restructure the welfare state in response to new social and financial demands. Moreover, welfare state reforms have been influenced by a social investment logic focusing on the generation of work incentives and activation. A more fundamental reform of the welfare state that has recently gained in attention is a basic income scheme. Most often, such a transformation of the social welfare system has been proposed by leftist/progressive actors calling for independence of welfare provision from the economy in a time where jobs will be replaced by automatized processes. However, basic income schemes have also been discovered by liberal forces as a means to replace existent welfare programs with a system that is aimed to lower public expenditures and foster work incentives.

But what do citizens think about the idea of a basic income scheme and in how far are citizens’ perceptions dependent on the framing (as a liberal or leftist/progressive program) and the exact design of such a scheme? We investigate these questions empirically – by implementing conjoint experiments – in two countries, where the introduction of a basic income scheme has recently been discussed most intensely. In Switzerland, citizens in June 2016 rejected a popular initiative that proposed a progressive form of an unconditional basic income. In Finland, the center-right government has been pushing a liberal version of a basic income. In January 2017 a national pilot scheme has begun that provides a guaranteed sum of €560 to 2’000 unemployed Finns aged 25-58.

Comparing these two cases enables us to gain insights on citizens’ preferences regarding basic income schemes in different welfare state contexts but also under differently framed public debates. This is relevant in so far as such a fundamental reorganization of the welfare system would not be possible without at least some popular support. Furthermore, from a methodological perspective, we contribute to recent developments to apply conjoint analyses in welfare research and more precisely, how this tool can be used to assess citizens’ preferences for policy solutions in different contexts.",,Beyond Complex Welfare Systems: Citizens’ Opinion towards Basic Income proposals Compared

Caretaker benefits reward people who engage in premature and irresponsible childbearing at the expense of those who take costly steps to prepare themselves to be good parents and to achieve self-support before having children. By flouting basic principles of fairness, the resulting perverse priorities become a serious shortcoming of Alstott's proposed caretaker benefit program.

While the former provides every individual with an equal monetary benefit, the latter ties monetary benefits to the amount of unpaid and care work performed by individuals. We assess the impact of these policy mixes by applying Eurogreen, a macrosimulation model tailored to Italy. Results suggest that while working time reduction directly drives a reduction of the aggregate amount of time spent by women in unpaid work, this does not imply a reduction in time poverty.

Social factors such as income, are more significant determinants of food security and health than lifestyle choices (Mikkonen &amp; Raphael, 2010).

Second, in response to the narrow focus on labour supply, I examine Mincome data and use a series of multiple regressions to explore the impact of a basic income on housing satisfaction.

In this article we critically examine this proposition. We first argue against the inherent functionalism of many accounts and instead propose a political economy framework that ties basic income directly to a series of mechanisms that may explain the opening up of basic income policy windows during recent crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic. It is equally important to carefully distinguish between different types of crises and we argue that two key competing types – cyclical and permanent crises – face a distinctive set of political economy constraints.

-19.926691,19.528404,2,"The notion of a universal basic income (“UBI”) has captivated academics, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and ordinary citizens in recent months. Pilot studies of a UBI are underway or in the works on three continents. And prominent voices from across the ideological spectrum have expressed support for a UBI or one of its variants, including libertarian Charles Murray, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, labor leader Andy Stern, and — most recently — former President Barack Obama. Although even the most optimistic advocates for a UBI will acknowledge that nationwide implementation lies years away, the design of a basic income will require sustained scholarly attention. This article seeks to advance the conversation among academics and policymakers about UBI implementation. 

Our prior work has focused on the philosophical foundations of a basic income; here, we build up from those foundations to identify the practical building blocks of a large-scale cash transfer program. After canvassing the considerations relevant to the design of a UBI, we arrive at a set of specific recommendations for policymakers. We propose a UBI of $6000 per person per year, paid to all citizens and lawful permanent residents via direct deposit in biweekly installments. We argue — contrary to other UBI proponents — that children and seniors should be included, that adjustments for household size and cost of living should be rejected, that recipients should have a limited ability to use future payments as collateral for short- and medium-term loans, and that the Social Security Administration should carry out the program. We also explain how a UBI could be financed through the consolidation of existing cash and near-cash transfer programs as well as the imposition of a relatively modest surtax on all earners.

Importantly, the building blocks of a UBI do not necessarily determine its outward face. By this, we mean that economically identical programs can be described in very different ways — e.g., as a UBI with no phaseout, a UBI that phases out with income, and a “negative income tax” — without altering any of the essential features. To be sure, packaging matters to the public perception of a UBI, and we consider reasons why some characterizations of the program may prove more popular than others. Our article seeks to sort the building blocks of a UBI out from the cosmetic components, thereby clarifying which elements of a UBI shape implementation and which ones affect only the outward appearance.",,The Architecture of a Basic Income

The distribution of time, as well as what people can or cannot do with their time, is a key issue among feminist debates. The main argument is that time allocation to paid and unpaid work is very different and unfair between genders.

But these demographics are not the only factors that correlate with attitudes toward unconditional basic income: subjective justice attitudes do as well. The justice norm of equity and unconditional basic income appear to be contradictory. On the other hand, people who find that there are deficits in covering the needs of society’s lower income groups tend to approve of unconditional basic income. Therefore, analyses show that attitudes toward unconditional basic income follow specific patterns and social regularities; and they were relatively stable between 2016 and 2018. As long as uncertainty predominates regarding the social costs and benefits of implementing such a basic income, the relatively high proportion of those in favor must be interpreted with care.

Basic income theorists say that AI and robots will eliminate jobs and that the introduction of basic income will be inevitable. But the problem is social security. The principle of a 'welfare state' must work in social security. The welfare state is based on mutual aid and social solidarity. It is a system in which citizens put taxes and insurance premiums into the community's piggy bank, and people who need them take them out according to the size they need. The entire nation saves money in piggy banks, but the n received is always a small number. The salary is generous because n is small. I don't take it right away, but I can always go and get help when I'm in danger and a need for social recognition arises. But there are no piggy banks in basic income countries. Everyone shares it as it is. It cannot be more equal than this, but the salary is inevitably low because there are many ns. And there is no social solidarity or mutual aid. The state just plays the role of Robin Hood. The contrast of redistribution varies by income level, and there is no social security or welfare. This is why social security cannot be left to basic income now and in the future.

We find evidence that for wealthy Germans, and for the rich half of European nations, higher levels of per capita income don't buy greater happiness. The reason appears to be adaptation. However even for the rich half of European nations such habituation may take over 5 years so the happiness gains that they experience, whilst not permanent, can still be relatively long-lasting. Finally we study a cross section of nations in 2005 from the World Gallup Poll and find that the past 45 years of economic growth (from 1960-2005) in the rich half of nations has not brought happiness gains above those that were already in place once the 1960s standard of living had been achieved.

Discussions of the “goals of development” now often emphasize the reduction of poverty, rather than raising average incomes per se. The role of social services—particularly basic health and education—has also received greater emphasis in the 1980s, viewed mainly as instruments for raising the incomes of the poor. But, in all these approaches, income growth of one sort or another is what development is all about. A rather different view of the meaning of development has recently found expression in the 1990 Human Development Report (HRD) produced by the United Nations Development Programme. A conceptual underpinning for this approach can be found in the work of Amartya Sen. The essence of this view is that human development—what people can actually do and be—is the overriding purpose of economic development. Underdevelopment is viewed as the lack of certain basic capabilities, rather than lack of income per se. We do not aim here to advocate one of these approaches over the other, but rather to explore their implications for development policy.

We develop a simple macroeconomic setup in which the social planner determines how to optimally intervene, through income taxation, in order to minimize the social cost, inclusive of infection and economic costs, of the spread of an epidemic disease. The disease lowers economic production and thus income by reducing the size of the labor force employed in productive activities, tightening thus the economy's overall resources constraint. We consider a framework in which the planner uses the collected tax revenue to intervene in either prevention (aimed at reducing the rate of infection) or treatment (aimed at increasing the speed of recovery). Both optimal prevention and treatment policies allow the economy to achieve a disease-free equilibrium in the long run but their associated costs are substantially different along the transitional dynamic path. By quantifying the social costs associated with prevention and treatment we determine which policy is most cost-effective under different circumstances, showing that prevention (treatment) is desirable whenever the infectivity rate is low (high).",,Optimal Control of Prevention and Treatment in a Basic Macroeconomic-Epidemiological Model

We then show that with self-interested voters who seek to minimize their own tax burdens, greater marginal-rate progression may well be preferred by middle-and upper-income voters; that for middle-income citizens the optimal schedule is a sharply progressive one; and that within the set of individually optimal schedules there exists a majority equilibrium, which is a progressive schedule which minimizes the burden on median-income or middle class citizens, at the expense of lower-and upper-income taxpayers.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-2727(88)90030-8,"Fairness, self-interest, and the politics of the progressive income tax"

This paper suggests two policy models of basic income that can be applied to Korea. The first model, the Basic Income Model I, combines basic income with national land holding tax. The Basic Income Model Ⅱ has a plan to procure the necessary revenue from land tax, environmental tax, and citizen income tax. If a basic income is introduced in Korea in the future, the actual policy should lie somewhere between Model Ⅰ and Model II.       Our simulation results show that under Model Ⅰ, where the amount of annual basic income per person will range from 300,000 Won to 2,300,000 Won, 97% of the total households will become net beneficiaries of the policy. In contrast, the annual basic income will rise to 3,600,000 Won per capita with Model II, making 83% of the total households net beneficiaries. As the dividend per capita is greater in Model Ⅱ, the redistributive effect of income, which is shown in terms of the Gini-coefficient improvement, is much larger in Model Ⅱ than in Model I. Yet, because Model Ⅱ requires 185 trillion Won for its implementation, it seems politically less feasible to apply the Model II to the current Korean society.     Even with the implementation of Model I, the softer model, we expect the following changes to take place in Korea. First, the propensity to seek rents will be reduced after the imposition of national land tax on all land owners. Second, inequality in land ownership will be mitigated and Chaebols and large enterprises will focus more on productive investments rather than on land speculation. Third, basic income raises the sense of entitlements among all citizens, which will lead to social inclusion and cohesion.

While high income countries can claw back the transfer to the higher income group through a progressive income tax, this is not possible in developing countries where most people operate in the informal sector. This note looks at an alternative to either narrow targeting or UBI. It uses household survey data from 52 low and middle-income countries to compare the poverty impact of a UBI to a transfer that is gradually reduced as estimated consumption increases. The taper can be set at different rates and can lead to zero transfers to households above a chosen threshold.

19.148476,-9.911009,4,"THE discussion concerning Professor Alilton Friedman's   income hypothesis led some investigators to conclude that observable quantitative differences between so-called within-group consumption elasticities and between-group consumption elasticities support the Friedman hypothesis. I am in qualified agreement with this conclusion-qualified in that I consider the reasoning that leads to the conclusion incomplete. The explanation of my position will start with emphasis on agreement, but it will end with the emphasis shifted to the qualifications. Take for some year a cross-section of households at large and compute the consumption-income relation for this universe. This measured relationship will not depend solely on differences between the permanent incomes of various households and on differences between their permanent (or regular) consumption. The relationship will also be affected by differences between   components of income, which may be positive or negative, and by differences between   components of consumption, which are in the nature of random additions to the regular consumption flow of the household or of random subtractions from it. If we accept the   income hypothesis, according to which the   relationship between income and consumption is a relationship between permanent income and permanent consumption and according to which the transitory components of income do not influence either constituent of consumption (or do not influence them appreciably), then we are led to expect that the apparent consumption-income relationship, computed from a cross-section of households at large, will understate the true consumption elasticities with respect to income. The simplest way of expressing the essential reason for this understatement of consumption elasticities may be to point out that in a universe of households at large the spread between measured incomes must be greater than the spread between   incomes and that statistical measurements attribute the observable differences in consumption to the greater differences between measured incomes rather than to the smaller differences between the consumption-governing   incomes. Assume, for example, that, out of a   income of 100 units, 80 units are consumed, while out of a   income of 200 units, 160 units are consumed. If these were the only two existing sizes of   income, statistical measurements would attribute the observable 80-unit differences in consumption per household, not to the 100unit differences in   income, but to greater differences. Hence consumption elasticities would be understated. This is because, as a consequence of negative transitory incomes, some measured incomes would be smaller than 100 units; and, as a consequence of positive transitory incomes, some measured incomes would exceed 200 units. Instead of considering cross-sections at large, let us now classify the universe of households into groups whose   income-earning capacities are typically different. Occupationally or locationally defined groups are of this character, and so are groups defined by age. Within each of these groups the household-to-household comparisons will lead to an underestimate of the true consumption elasticities, for reasons that are identical with those explained for cross-section measurements at large. But we may now also compute consumption",https://doi.org/10.1086/258221,Relative Permanent Income: Elaboration and Synthesis

-35.84074,40.55221,3,"Debates among Liberals on social justice have played a major role in current discussion on basic income (or universal benefit). In this paper, the notion is considered on the basis of the “economics of liberal egalitarianism”, for which the anchor point is to be found in Rawls’philosophical works. Although he certainly does not support basic income, he still provides an appropriate general framework to consider it, in particular because of the hierarchy of his principles of justice (I). At the third level of this hierarchy, the interpretation of the “difference principle” appeared controversial when applied to the case of the “Malibu surfers”, an illustration thanks to which Van Parijs was able to defend the unconditional nature of basic income (II). There remains the transition from the philosophy to the economics of basic income, which allows considering it as a precise alternative of negative income tax. At this stage, a rereading of Friedman’s intuition on this topic results in seeing basic income as a “universal tax credit” (3).

The author believes that this topic can become one of the most relevant for social-philosophical research. The author notes that although the problem has been of concern to philosophers and scientists for a long time, it has become especially relevant only recently – over the past ten years. The following reasons are given as an explanation: (a) recent experiments on the introduction of a universal basic income in Western countries, (b) the trend toward automation and technologization, (c) the transformation of the economy, which is becoming more and more precarious. The author notes that the topic of universal basic income has become relevant even in Russian science, however, not in social philosophy, as in the West, but mainly in economics. The author argues that, since the discussion about basic income in the economic dimension has already taken place, it should be expanded to the field of social philosophy. To do this, the author raises a number of questions that will shed light on the social-philosophical nature of the problem of universal basic income – freedom, justice, welfare state, etc. Special attention is paid to the curious ideological transformations that became possible by the emergence of topic of basic income. First of all, basic income contributes to the formation of new ideologies, such as post-capitalism. Secondly, basic income itself can be considered as a new ideology, which is a synthesis of other ideological trends – libertarianism, feminism, Marxism, etc. Thirdly, post-capitalism, which emphasizes basic income, opens up much more significant problems than replacing labor and turning all people into a precariat.

However, a higher pension without a means test would in four cases out of five mean misdirecting aid to those not in need. Even in cases where the current statutory pension entitlement is lower than the entitlement to basic provision (Grundsicherung), as part of a combined household income the pension still usually succeeds in averting old age poverty. It would therefore make more sense to deduct a personal allowance from the means test, irrespective of the type of income involved. An allowance of up to 200 euros per month would benefit almost all those originally identified as potentially needing assistance if they simultaneously claimed basic provision. However, this would involve the needy being treated differently depending on their individual income in old age. Alternatively, to avoid this unequal treatment, the standard rates of old-age basic provision could be raised for all indigent pensioners.

35.77944,2.9773176,4,"We have so far talked about the national income, price level, rate of interest etc. in an ad hoc manner – without investigating the forces that govern their values. The basic objective of macroeconomics is to develop theoretical tools, called models, capable of describing the processes which determine the values of these variables. Specifically, the models attempt to provide a theoretical explanation to questions such as what causes periods of slow growth or recessions in the economy, or increment in the price level, or a rise in unemployment. It is difficult to account for all the variables at the same time. Thus, when we concentrate on the determination of a particular variable, we must hold the values of all other variables constant. This is a stylization typical of almost any theoretical exercise and is called the assumption of ceteris paribus, which literally means ‘other things remaining equal’. You can think of the procedure as follows – in order to solve for the values of two variables and y from two equations, we solve for one variable, say x, in terms of y from one equation first, and then substitute this value into the other equation to obtain the complete solution. We apply the same method in the analysis of the macroeconomic system. In this chapter, we deal with the determination of national income under the assumption of a fixed price of final goods and a constant rate of interest in the economy. The theoretical model used in this chapter is based on the theory given by John Maynard Keynes",,CLASS 12 Economics - Introductory MacroeconomicsDetermination of Income and Employment
10.894766,-4.1373963,4,"In a 2017 interview, Microsoft founder Bill Gates recommended taxing robots to slow the pace of automation. Funds raised could be used to retrain and financially support displaced workers. Up to 47 percent of U.S.   are at risk by advancements in artificial intelligence. Low-wage workers currently hold a majority of those at-risk jobs. Increased automation is likely to exacerbate income inequality. 

While employment changes due to automation are not new, advances in artificial intelligence threaten many more   much more quickly than historic automation did. Accelerated automation presents two problems: a revenue problem and a human problem. The revenue problem exists because the tax system is designed to tax labor more heavily, as labor is less likely to be able to avoid taxation. Capital investment, on the other hand, is taxed more lightly because capital is mobile and can escape taxation. When capital becomes labor, as in automation, the bottom falls out of the system. The human problem is first that most people need income from working to survive. Some scholars have advocated for a governmentally provided universal basic income (UBI). Taxing robots could in theory provide revenue for a UBI, although any source of revenue would work just as well. While this would solve the survival problem, humans need more than basic survival. In his classic work, psychologist Abraham Maslow put survival at the bottom of his hierarchy of needs. Work satisfies the higher order needs of social identity and self-esteem. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), enacted in December 2017, significantly cut the U.S. corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent. In addition, TCJA increased tax benefits for purchasing equipment (which would include automation), significantly enhancing bonus depreciation. The new tax legislation continued and deepened the existing tax bias towards automation. This article explores policy options for solving the revenue problem and the jobs problem, including a discussion and critique of UBI proposals and recommendations for other policy options, such as an enhanced earned income tax credit, incentives for employers, and reviving an idea from the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps.",,I Robot: U Tax?

This idea has been around for a long time and was first formulated more than two centuries ago. There have been several times when it has attracted attention over that timespan, and these bouts of interest typically coincide with a specific and recurring combination of circumstances. The current wave of interest began about three to four years ago, in the aftermath of austerity, and is now coming to a peak with serious prospects for some form of UBI being adopted as the official policy of more than one political party. Interestingly, the idea has support from both left and right but also attracts hostility and criticism from both sides, with some of the most trenchant criticism coming from the left. In discussing the idea of a UBI it is very important to be clear as to what it is that we are talking about, as several similar but ultimately different kinds of proposal are often grouped under the same umbrella term. A survey of the proposals currently put forward in the UK, and of the responses to them, reveals both a mixture of motives behind the advocacy of such schemes and the serious problems, both practical and principled, that they pose. On the left, such suggestions are frequently contrasted with a rival kind of proposal, that of Universal Basic Services (UBS), which is in many ways a revival of a much older tradition of socialist thought, but there is no such clear alternative on offer from the free-market side.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3852056,Universal Basic Income: Is it a Good Idea?

The relationship is particularly strong for regular and sport-related volunteering. The basic Spirit Level thesis is therefore confirmed as applicable to volunteering. However, while the thesis involves just one theoretical explanation for the income inequality/well-being relationship, namely status anxiety, in the case of volunteering, other variables are also found to be at play, including government social spending, available leisure time and geo-historical traditions.

By equal pay we mean that everyone in society receives the same remuneration regardless of the type of work, level of effort, or unemployed or not. From an economic point of view, there are large negative incentive effects with such an arrangement. The reason is that the principle of ‘equal pay for all’ breaks the relationship between the workers’ effort and the payment associated with the effort. Furthermore, neo-classical economics would argue that there is no incentive to work if there is no financial payoff compared to not working. Also from a Catholic social teaching viewpoint, there is no support for an ‘equal pay for all’ arrangement.

A critical question about this attention is whether it amounts to more than “just a fad”.

This argument is developed from semi-structured interviews with stakeholders who have relevant expertise in and around the Basic Income discourse, as well as thematic analysis of print media discussion of Basic Income in 2015 – 2017.

This thesis examines the significance of the attention through the framework developed by Levitas as the Imaginary Reconstitution of Society. That is, it considers the discourse around Basic Income as fragmentary utopias, containing a mixture of critiques of the present, visions of the future “good society”, and policy proposals to move between the two. This leads to the conclusions that (i) the attention to Basic Income is rather attention to a plurality of Basic Incomes, with different purposes and bases, and (ii) that Basic Income cannot be understood as a policy in isolation, but instead as a part of a broader policy platform.",,"""Basic Income is an idea whose time has come"" : but why here, why now, and in what way?"

Next, the focus is shifted to the current debate on the introduction of a basic income, a completely unconditional grant paid ex ante to all citizens. It is argued that if basic income is to have a chance of meeting the strong twofold condition stipulated in the conjecture, some major changes are required in the way one usually thinks about justice and efficiency in connection with social policy.

However, proposals following this principle will hardly achieve political consensus as can be derived from reactions to the model of ifo or the board of economic advisors. IZA is therefore proposing workfare as an effective alternative, which may accomplish a strong incentive for the acceptance of low paid jobs without having to cut the current welfare level. Simulations based on a micro-econometric labor supply model show that this could add to the workforce an additional number of 800,000 workers. Roughly the same effect could be achieved by the ifo model, however, at the expense of massive cuts of disposable income for welfare recipients. Hence, workfare turns out as an efficient alternative.

Piloting and evaluating a CBI as a Cluster Randomized Control Trial (RCT) raises the question of whether intervention and comparison groups would be in equipoise, and thus whether randomization would be ethical. We believe that most researchers would accept that additional income, or reduced conditions on receiving income would be likely to improve health, especially at lower income levels. However, there are genuine uncertainties about the impacts on other outcomes, and CBI as a mechanism of providing income. There is also less consensus amongst civil servants and politicians about the impacts on health, and substantial disagreement about whether these would outweigh other impacts. We believe that an RCT is ethical because of these uncertainties. We also argue that the principle of equipoise should apply to randomized and non-randomized trials; that randomization is a fairer means of allocating to intervention and comparison groups; and that there is an ethical case for experimentation to generate higher-quality evidence for policymaking that may otherwise do harm.",https://doi.org/10.1093/phe/phab001,What Are the Implications of Applying Equipoise in Planning Citizens Basic Income Pilots in Scotland?
30.49066,-24.47546,4,"The crisis of the welfare state could hinder the right to work sanctioned by the Constitution, and could make the already precarious realization of other aspects of the social contract even more difficult. This being the situation, in which we can consider the problem of unemployment as being long-term and widespread, there are three possible sceneries, each having their own particular interventional policies. Policies of the first sort aim to change the supply for work both through a radical deregulation of the industrial relationship system, and through a reduction in social expenses. The second possible scenery proceeds from the belief that an increasing demand for private goods and services is inadequate, and suggests solutions that rely on the demand for goods, while developing at the same time the advanced infrastructures and the supply for collective services. Meades notion of Citizen's Income represents the third alternative scenery, where the social contract is no longer founded on the right to a job, but on the right to an income. The introduction of the idea of Citizen's Income could favour the distinction of productivity from security problems, it would inable considering work not as a condemnation, but rather as a matter choice, motivated by profit or direct utility; favouring a more liberal production of collective goods thereby limiting a too intrusive political power, while increasing those liberties granted to citizens.",,Are the solutions to the high unemployment puzzle

-27.34693,43.97165,3,"Universal basic income (UBI) is an approach to income security that guarantees every individual in a political community (be it a nation or a subnational unit such as a state, province, or municipality) an unconditional and sufficient income to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, transportation, and the other necessities of life. UBI differs from state-sponsored social insurance schemes that became widespread in welfare states during latter half of the 20th century. Social insurance is funded by mandatory employer and/or employee contributions, and is tied to specific events affecting workers, such as loss of paid employment, parenting a new child, or retirement from the labor force. UBI also differs from last-resort income support programs such as social assistance (often called “welfare” or “workfare”). Such programs are meant to respond to those in immediate and dire financial need. Qualifying for social assistance depends on proving one’s eligibility to government officials through an application process that is typically complicated, demeaning, and stigmatizing. Social assistance often requires certain behaviors of recipients, such as participation in life-skills training or (in the case of workfare) work in low-skill jobs at low pay. In contrast, UBI is available to everyone on an unconditional basis, with no requirement for advance contributions, no stigma attached to those receiving it, and no work or other behavioral requirements. The Basic Income Earth Network defines UBI in this way: “A basic income is a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement.” Basic income has the following five characteristics: (1) Periodic: paid at regular intervals (for example, every month), not as a one-off grant. (2) Cash payment: paid in an appropriate medium of exchange, allowing those who receive it to decide what they spend it on. It is not, therefore, paid either in kind (such as food or services) or in vouchers dedicated to a specific use. (3) Individual: paid on an individual basis—and not, for instance, to households. (4) Universal: paid to all, without a means test. (5) Unconditional: paid without a requirement to work or to demonstrate willingness-to-work. Basic income (or approximations thereof) often go by different names, such as guaranteed income, citizens’ income, unconditional cash transfer, refundable tax credits, or social dividend.",https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780195389678-0279,Universal Basic Income

28.742949,-9.856252,4,"Today the United States has one of the highest poverty rates among the world's rich industrial democracies. The Failed Welfare Revolution shows us that things might have turned out differently. During the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers in three presidential administrations tried to replace the nation's existing welfare system with a revolutionary program to guarantee Americans basic economic security. Surprisingly from today's vantage point, guaranteed income plans received broad bipartisan support in the 1960s. One proposal, President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan, nearly passed into law in the 1970s, and President Carter advanced a similar bill a few years later. The failure of these proposals marked the federal government's last direct effort to alleviate poverty among the least advantaged and, ironically, sowed the seeds of conservative welfare reform strategies under President Reagan and beyond. This episode has largely vanished from America's collective memory. Here, Brian Steensland tells the whole story for the first time--from why such an unlikely policy idea first developed to the factors that sealed its fate. His account, based on extensive original research in presidential archives, draws on mainstream social science perspectives that emphasize the influence of powerful stakeholder groups and policymaking institutions. But Steensland also shows that some of the most potent obstacles to guaranteed income plans were cultural. Most centrally, by challenging Americans' longstanding distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor, the plans threatened the nation’s cultural, political, and economic status quo.",,Introduction to The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy

Ironically, the scheme is now being criticised as being one of the main factors driving the social effects of prolonged welfare dependence. This paper updates the Office of Evaluation and Audit 1997 report that evaluated the scheme. While this paper shows that the CDEP scheme has a significant effect of reducing social pathologies, vis-a-vis unemployment, the positive effect of the scheme is generally substantially less than the protective effect of having mainstream (non-CDEP) scheme employment. Consequently, it is the lack of mainstream employment options, rather than the presence of the CDEP scheme that drives the social pathologies identified in recent public debate. Notwithstanding the evident community development associated with the CDEP scheme, it cannot be the whole answer for disadvantaged Indigenous communities, which also need a mixture of economic development, infrastructure spending, and bottom-up policy initiatives. Another policy option might be to facilitate mobility where the prospect for regional growth is limited; however, it should be noted that incentives for individuals to move are altered when the other development policies work.",,A Half-hearted Defence of the CDEP Scheme

These include pecuniary emulation, demand pull inflation, and political resistance to full employment so that the rentier class does not have to contend with entrepreneurs *and* the working class over the distribution of the productive surplus.

Every American over eighteen would be entitled to a share and would participate in directing its share voting choices. Corporations and wealthy individuals would donate stocks, bonds, cash, or other assets to the fund just like they do to other philanthropic ventures now. The fund would pay out dividends to its citizen-shareholders that would grow as the fund grows.

It would be a major institutional investor beholden not to a small elite group of stockholders pushing for short-term gain but to everyone. The fund would reward corporations that made sure their actions didn't harm people, communities, and the environment, and it would enable them to invest in innovations that would take more than a few months to pay off. Which is another reason corporations would donate to the fund—they could be freed from the constant pressure to maximize their quarterly share price and would essentially be subsidized for doing good.

This paper examines the implications of moving to a system where benefits are universal and the marginal tax rate schedule is simplified to a constant rate, refered to as a basic income — flat tax system. The Melbourne Institute Tax Transfer Simulator(MITTS), a behavioural micro-simulation model of the Australian tax-transfer system is used to examine the distributional,labour supply and government expenditure effects of moving to a basic income—flat tax system. Providing basic income levels that coincide with current benefit rates is costly, with a marginal tax rate of over fifty percent required for revenue neutrality. Such a system, while equitable, is found to reduce labour supply. If a version to inequality is high, this system is found to be socialy optimal, even after reductions in labour supply. Decreases in the marginal tax rate improve work incentives and increase the supply of labour, but increase inequality and impose a significant cost burden on government. A decline in the level of basic income of at least half is required to fund a reduction in the marginal tax rate to thirty percent. While the distortions to behaviour are minimal with this final system, it is extremely inequitable and social welfare reducing, even after a counting for changes in labour supply.",,Moves to a basic income-flat tax system in Australia: implications for the distribution of income and supply of labour

We consider three UBI transfers with increasing levels of generosity and identify scenarios in which the poor are no worse off than in the baseline scenario of existing social transfers. We find that for poverty levels not to increase under a UBI reform, the level of spending must increase substantially with respect to the baseline. Accordingly, the required increase in tax burdens is high throughout. We find that the increase in the average tax rate that would be consistent with not hurting the poor is almost universally above 30%, limiting the feasibility of a UBI reform due to political resistance and efficiency costs.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2023.2199566,"Universal Basic Income Programs: How Much Would Taxes Need to Rise?

-3.3542578,2.262038,2,"The article is devoted to modeling the possibilities of overcoming absolute monetary poverty in Russia based on the concept of an unconditional basic income (UBI). It is shown that due to the unclear consequences of the impact of the introduction of UBI payments on various aspects of the life of modern societies, due to the impossibility of making payments in full compliance with the basic principles of UBI, such as universality and unconditionality due to political, economic and other restrictions, imitation is widely used in the world to evaluate its possible effects. A review of approaches to simulation modeling in the EU countries, international research, and financial organizations (OECD, World Bank, International Monetary Fund) and the Russian experience in modeling the effects of the introduction of transitional forms of UBI is carried out. The formulation of the task of introducing the UBI to overcome absolute monetary poverty has been carried out. It is shown that to solve this problem, it is expedient to consider the UBI as a guaranteed minimum per capita income of a poor household, equal to the regional subsistence minimum or the conditional basic income for overcoming poverty. To increase the actual incomes of low-income households up to the regional subsistence minimum, it is proposed to pay them, after providing standard targeted social support, the additional differentiated regional social payment (poverty benefit). Algorithms for determining this payment have been developed. The substantiation of the possibility and feasibility of modeling the effects of poverty benefit according to the domestic model of the tempo-deflator type has been carried out. The results of predictive calculations for this model are presented. It is shown that the additional revenues of the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation not only compensate for the initial costs of implementing the conditional UBI program but also annually exceed the initial costs by about 1,35 times. The country's leadership was proposed to combine the current system of targeted social support for the poor with payments of the conditional UBI to more consistently solve the problem of absolute monetary poverty",https://doi.org/10.19181/lsprr.2021.17.2.4,Simulation of scenarios for overcoming absolute monetary poverty in Russia based on the concept of unconditional basic income
18.103916,6.6287727,4,"What is the proper definition of gifts for purposes of the exclusion from income? The authors consider whether there is a principled policy justification for excluding gifts. Concluding that there is, that policy becomes the base from which the proper definition is ascertained. The raison d'etre for taxing income is that it represents the market value of current consumption plus the present value of future consumption. Tax law is indifferent as to the identity of who enjoys the future consumption. Once income has been taxed, taxpayer is entitled to use it to purchase consumption without incurring any additional income tax. Taxpayer should be permitted to vicariously enjoy someone else's consumption, and the exclusion of gifts permits him to do so. A single tax could be obtained by taxing the gift to the donee and giving the donor a deduction, but that would do violence to the goals of progressivity. The principle of allowing vicarious enjoyment conflicts with the principle of taxing persons according to their ability to pay (horizontal equity), and so the two must be balanced against each other. The authors believe that the scales favor gift exclusion, or is in equilibrium. The Duberstein standard of detached and disinterested generosity for determining what constitutes a gift is appropriate in most cases. While those conditions typically favor allowing vicarious enjoyment, other conditions can exist which change the weight accorded to either of the competing principles in favor of horizontal equity. There are circumstances where the role of the transferee makes the principle of horizontal equity dominant. Duberstein should be modified to reflect that consideration. The article questions whether costs of making a gift, including gift taxes, regardless of who paid, should be added to the donee's basis. Also, the authors criticize the Supreme Court's treatment of net gifts in the Diedrich case. The last issue concerns the standard for determining what constitutes a gift for purposes of the charitable deduction. The authors conclude that the Duberstein standard is inappropriate. The purposes for allowing a charitable deduction are quite different from the reason for excluding private gifs from income. The test should be whether the transferor received a financial benefit of a lesser value in return. A difference in value will be deductible if the transferor can prove that it was intentional. Perhaps, the most difficult issue in this area is what treatment should be accorded a transferor who receives a religious benefit in exchange. The article examines that issue and the problem of valuing a religious benefit.",,"'Gifts, Gafts, and Gefts' - the Income Tax Definition and Treatment of Private and Charitable 'Gifts' and a Principled Justification for the Exclusion of Gifts from Income"

And globally, such taxation, if adopted differently, can cause great tax competition between countries; iii) Transparency obligations are necessary to mitigate bias in hiring tools, but not self-sufficient, because the bias is complex, mainly due to the multiplicity of discriminatory factors and to the opacity of the logic in machine learning.&#x0D;",https://doi.org/10.5752/p.2318-7999.2021v24n47p396-421,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LABOR

The Tax-Benefit Model applied is the static micro-simulation model of EUROMOD. A household labour supply model is simulated with different tax rules where MGI is an option. The simulated tax regimes are Negative Income Tax (NIT), Workfare Tax (WF) and Universal Basic Income (UBI). These exercises of behavioural micro-simulation tax-benefit are performed at national and regional level. Our main finding is that changes in labour supply due to these tax-transfer rules are small and this is in favour of such income support policies. Concerning tax-transfer rules without hourâ€™s constraint, such as UBI and NIT, they imply labour disincentives more in the South than in the North of the country, and the effect is amplified with the increase of generosity level.

The Citizens’ Basic Income Feasibility Study Steering Group completed their work in June 2020, and submitted reports on possible basic income pilots in Scotland and how these might be evaluated, along with complementary studies modelling the possible economic impacts of a basic income on Scotland and potential interactions between a CBI pilot and the current social security arrangements.

Yet an increasing number of proponents, especially in international development and public policy circles, see basic income as an efficient technological solution to poverty and economic insecurity. Critical development studies scholars have overwhelmingly problematized such ‘rendering technical’ of complex social, economic and political issues. In this paper, we use a critical development lens to point to two areas of particular danger to the transformative potential of basic income: coloniality and class relations. We do so through two case studies: a proposed basic income for Indigenous Australians and the support of UBI by high-net-worth individuals in California’s Silicon Valley.

Estimating the possible consequences of introducing a basic income, however, remains an equation with too many unknowns. As a result, even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded unprecedented measures in the social sphere, preference was given to traditional mechanisms to support the economy, employment, and living standards. The results of experiments with basic income, carried out over the past half-century, due to their limited scope, are still clearly insufficient to make an unambiguous conclusion about the viability of this scheme and the feasibility of its implementation on a national scale. At the same time, these experiments showed that basic income, when incorporated into existing social protection systems, can become an effective tool for smoothing regional disparities, the vulnerable position of a certain age and gender groups, as well as improving physical and mental health indicators. Moreover, they allow us, with some caution, to conclude that concerns about the negative impact of basic income on employment are grossly exaggerated. With regard to Russia, promising directions for the implementation of pilot programs could be as following: stimulating the development of lagging regions of the Federation, supporting young people who have recently entered the labor market and citizens of pre-retirement age, as well as, in light of unfavorable demographic trends, the introduction of unconditional cash payments for minor children",https://doi.org/10.19181/lsprr.2021.17.3.2,The migration component in the demographic development of Russia in the post-war period (1951–2020)

We then consider approaches to calculating cost in a UK context to estimate budgetary burdens that need to be met by the state. Next, we suggest means of modelling the prospective impact of UBI on health before asserting means of costing that impact, using a microsimulation approach. We then outline a set of fiscal options for funding any shortfall in returns. Finally, we suggest that fiscal strategy can be designed specifically with health impact in mind by modelling the impact of reform on health and feeding that data cyclically back into tax transfer module of the microsimulation.",,"Modelling the size, cost and health impacts of universal basic income: what can be done in advance of a trial?"

This paper suggests two policy models of basic income that can be applied to Korea. The first model, the Basic Income Model I, combines basic income with national land holding tax. The Basic Income Model Ⅱ has a plan to procure the necessary revenue from land tax, environmental tax, and citizen income tax. If a basic income is introduced in Korea in the future, the actual policy should lie somewhere between Model Ⅰ and Model II. BR Our simulation results show that under Model Ⅰ, where the amount of annual basic income per person will range from 300,000 Won to 2,300,000 Won, 97% of the total households will become net beneficiaries of the policy. In contrast, the annual basic income will rise to 3,600,000 Won per capita with Model II, making 83% of the total households net beneficiaries. As the dividend per capita is greater in Model Ⅱ, the redistributive effect of income, which is shown in terms of the Gini-coefficient improvement, is much larger in Model Ⅱ than in Model I. Yet, because Model Ⅱ requires 185 trillion Won for its implementation, it seems politically less feasible to apply the Model II to the current Korean society.BR Even with the implementation of Model I, the softer model, we expect the following changes to take place in Korea. First, the propensity to seek rents will be reduced after the imposition of national land tax on all land owners. Second, inequality in land ownership will be mitigated and Chaebols and large enterprises will focus more on productive investments rather than on land speculation. Third, basic income raises the sense of entitlements among all citizens, which will lead to social inclusion and cohesion. Lastly, the welfare system will be reinforced and become more sustainable by granting dividend to the middle-class under the basic income system.",https://doi.org/10.38080/crh.2017.08.120.250,"Basic Income and National Land Tax in Korea : Background, Implementation Plans and the Estimated Effects"

Though Rhys-Williams’s campaign was unsuccessful, it has had a major impact on how basic income has been understood in Britain.

Recent historical scholarship now enables us to comprehend the twentieth century evolution of this and similar ideas. UBI is intriguing in having vociferous backers drawn both from the libertarian right—such as, notably, Milton Friedman in the form of his negative income tax proposal—but also from the emancipation‐embracing left—such as Michel Foucault and Phillipe Van Parijs.

This article challenges the views of proponents that their claims are ‘on trend' with developments in markets and technology. It does so by examining two supposed ‘tipping points' concerning crises in the production of value in capitalism and in the availability of and attachment to work. Through a rigorous examination of available evidence, the article demonstrates that the stories contained in post-work discourses about business models, technologies, labour markets and workers are not empirically sustainable.

A recent narrative, endorsed by tech-billionaires, says we face mass unemployment, and we need a basic income. In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is a purely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Both the global financial crisis from 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 illustrate the importance of social and legal policy, and suggest it is time to learn. Taking lessons from history, it is clear that unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy.

The concept of universal basic income (UBI) is presented as a tool for reducing poverty through guaranteed financial transfer by the state to each individual. The financial transfer, or UBI, allows a person to cover their minimum expenses.

In this paper we address problems of economic policy in the case that UBI is introduced in Europe.

Majority voting supports the basic income scheme as mean relative to median household skill increases. Household fertility and skill level are inversely related under the scheme.

-11.749522,-7.940011,2,"Proponents of income and job guarantee schemes agree on two things. The first is that both the market economy and the modern welfare state have failed many members of society by increasing the precariousness of the labor market, reducing safety nets, and leaving many without the basic resources for a descent living. Poverty, income inequality and unemployment are pervasive features of capitalism and modern welfare often takes the form of punitive measures aiming to discipline the “undeserving” poor or the unemployed. The second is that to begin addressing these problems, public policy needs to provide some form of universal guarantees to all citizens. It is the nature of these guarantees that represents the sharp division in policy recommendations. Income guarantee supporters champion the provision of an adequate standard of living by affording sufficient resources to all member of society. They argue that this objective can be achieved by guaranteeing a minimum income to all (a basic income guarantee, or BIG hereafter). Job creation proponents want to guarantee access to a job that could provide a minimum income to the economically active population (and their dependents). They believe that adequate resources can be provided by guaranteeing a job to all, usually through programs as the Employer of Last Resort (ELR). The key distinction between the two is that basic income advocates want to decouple the income-work relationship observed in modern economies on the basis that economic justice and freedom require that resources are provided to individuals without the",,COMMON GOALS—DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS: CAN BASIC INCOME AND JOB GUARANTEES DELIVER THEIR OWN PROMISES

In this article, we examine what it means for the state to institute a right to basic income. The normative literature on basic income has developed numerous arguments in support of basic income as an inextricable component of a just social order, but there exists little analysis about basic income within a jurisprudential or philosophical rights perspective. In our view, strong reasons of either a principled or a pragmatic nature in support of instituting a basic income scheme nevertheless often fall short of ascribing to basic income a distinctive Hohfeldian rights status. This article aims to partially redress this gap by examining two sets of questions. First, what are the implications – ethical and practical – of adopting basic income as a legal right as opposed to a mere policy? Second, we also enquire whether there should be such a right: what, if anything, is the ethical foundation that warrants granting basic income a distinctive legal rights status? This article suggests that any such foundation must be grounded in comparative evaluation and discusses several comparative strategies available to basic income advocates. The aim of this article is not to offer a definite argument in favor of a legal right to basic income, but to chart several lines of argument that a rights perspective might add to the contemporary discussion.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0191453715625439,Is there (or should there be) a <i>right</i> to basic income?
4.243784,37.13614,4,"Amy Castro and Stacia West (2022), with whom I have had the opportunity to exchange ideas on these pages, defend the need to continue experimenting with cash transfer policies through new experiments or pilot projects such as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) that they personally helped to design and evaluate. I agree with them. As I argued in my first contribution to this debate, I sincerely believe that experiments on unconditional income schemes can provide very useful and valuable information in moving towards the full establishment of an unconditional basic income (UBI). In this regard, we should welcome the recent creation of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania, which will surely contribute to the systematization of study and the accumulation of a scientific corpus on income policies in general, and on UBI in particular. Castro and West defend the appropriateness of continuing to experiment with unconditional cash transfer policies, i.e., UBI, for two reasons. On the one hand, and despite the large number of experiments carried out so far, they argue that we still need to gather more empirical evidence on the possible effects of UBI on individuals, especially on those who are more vulnerable and more likely to be marginalized. The scientific literature, they argue, has not provided conclusive answers as to what measurable effects UBI could have on people, what amount would be most appropriate, or what the frequency of payments should be, for example. On the other hand, they defend the need to continue experimenting to determine the best strategy for implementing a UBI at the national level, given the particularities of each political and institutional system. Their laudable aim is to ensure that an eventual UBI does not repeat or perpetuate the mistakes associated with the design and implementation of traditional policies that, although well-intentioned in most cases, have relied on narratives and conceptual frameworks that feed and legitimize stereotypes, the singling out and the stigmatization of the most vulnerable and historically excluded people and groups. To illustrate this characteristic (and even constitutive) feature of our welfare states, they give as an example of the way in which the housing policies implemented during the New Deal era, or the stimulus package implemented in the U.S. to mitigate the economic consequences of COVID-19, have carried over these same errors and biases both in their design and in their implementation, and have therefore ended up exacerbating certain racial and economic inequalities. Paradoxically, they point out, even the SEED program itself has been marred to some extent by these same gaps and pitfalls, both in its design and its implementation. Despite its good intentions, this program could not prevent some of its potential beneficiaries from refusing to participate for fear of losing other benefits or public aid to which they were already entitled, or to avoid having to interact with a public administration with which they have never had a good relationship and that they have always distrusted. Indeed, as they note paraphrasing Bidadanure (2019), “the devil is in the details of the UBI implementation.” I agree with this analysis, although their doubts regarding the possible effects or individual impacts of the UBI should be qualified in light of the empirical evidence accumulated by the numerous experiments carried out so far in very different economic, social, cultural, and historical contexts. I believe that we have already collected enough data and information to infer that the unconditionality and individuality associated with UBI generally lead to positive individual results, for example, regarding subjective well-being, health, happiness, food, reduced stress and debt, increased interpersonal and institutional trust, and community participation, to name just a few indicators (Laín, 2021). On the other hand, if they are concerned about questions as to the amount of UBI or the frequency of payments, it should be noted that the scientific literature offers strong arguments to answer these questions. For example, regarding the amount, several authors have argued that it should be set, as a general rule, near the poverty threshold established in each country (Arcarons, Raventós, & Torrens, 2014) or, more generally, that it should be “high enough” to secure a decent life (Torry, 2019, pp. 23–24).11 The general assembly of the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) held in Seoul in 2016 discussed this reference to a “high enough” amount. Although there is no specific criterion shared by all the organizations affiliated to the BIEN, it is understood that this minimum amount, along with regularity, individuality, universality, and unconditionality, is one of the key features of the definition of universal basic income. The resolution of this debate is available at https://basicincome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Basic-Income-definition-longer-explanation-1.pdf. As for the frequency of payments, there are powerful reasons put forward by Philippe Van Parijs or Carole Pateman, for example, that recommend a regular monthly payment as opposed to a one-off payment or the idea of the “basic grant” defended by Bruce Ackerman or Anne Alstott, among others (Olin Wright, 2006). Thus, although there may always be questions worth discussing along these lines, I believe that, by themselves, they do not justify the need to continue carrying out UBI experiments. While continuing to conduct UBI experiments would not be justified by the need to obtain more empirical evidence in relation to these first questions, I do believe, as Castro and West defend in their second argument, that it is justified by the need to find the best strategy for implementing UBI on a large scale. There is no shortcut or panacea, nor a single magical policy able to solve all the social, economic, or gender problems plaguing our societies by itself at a single stroke. This includes UBI, however universal and unconditional it may be. The key, again, lies in the details. On the theoretical and analytical level of debate, for example, Simon Birnbaum and Jurgen De Wispelaere (2021) have argued that the “power to say no” (Casassas, 2018; Widerquist, 2013) that we usually associate with UBI, and that should allow recipients to take a stand against contractual relationships that they consider degrading or unacceptable, must be upheld with caution and always with careful consideration paid to the starting or the background position from which each of these recipients declare this “no.” Also, some authors and commentators from various feminist perspectives have also suggested that the unconditionality of UBI could discourage some women from entering the labor market. This would perpetuate their subordinate position in the public sphere in favor of the greater visibility and power of their partners and of men in general (Baker, 2008; Federici, 2012; Miller, Yamamori, & Zelleke, 2019). At the most empirical level, the rationale of some unconditional policies similar to UBI, as in the case of the subsidies launched in Iran in 2010, for example, shows that the design of any economic benefit is always highly sensitive to issues that have to do with structural relations of power and domination. In the Iranian case, the beneficiary of the allowance was by de facto the head of the household, which in that country, as in most, continues to mean the man. Thus, as Castro and West criticize, the design of a well-intentioned social policy can lead to questionable or even negative results from the perspective of gender equality. Obviously, none of these three examples, nor the low take-up rates recorded for the SEED project, call into question the potential factual virtues of a UBI or challenge its normative desirability. Rather, they call attention to how the eventual design and implementation of such a policy must always consider the details, so its emancipatory potential does not become a perpetuation or reinforcement of the ideological biases and the administrative errors carried over from more conservative traditional conditional policies. Other UBI experiments, such as the B-MINCOME project in Barcelona, Spain, which I had the opportunity to take part in, considered some of these “details” and tried to deal with them from the outset. Thus, for example, we were aware that, although the conditions of participation were quite lax (basically, the requirements were to live in one of the participating neighborhoods for at least one year prior to the experiment, to have a low income, and to be or have been a user of the municipal social services), there would be a contingent of potential beneficiaries who, for some reason, would not apply to participate. To mitigate these foreseeable low take-up rates, letters were sent to the 4,824 people who made up the target population. These letters included the detailed information about the project in three different languages, along with the application form that they could fill out and send back to the city council for free. In addition, 2,383 of these candidates were successfully contacted by telephone to briefly explain the project again. Anticipating that this would not be enough, the letters and phone calls also included an invitation to attend one of the 400 information sessions held in the candidates’ neighborhoods. These sessions were attended by 2,203 people, 92.5 percent of those who had been contacted by phone, or 45.7 percent of the total number of candidates. Finally, a total of 2,525 applications were received: 2,039 (92.4 percent) were delivered in person during the briefings, and only 486 (19.2 percent) were sent by post. Thus, as we demonstrated (Laín & Julià, 2018), the fact of attending the information sessions had a determining effect on the take-up rate: 92.3 percent of the attending candidates completed and handed in their application forms for participation. Likewise, it should also be noted that from the beginning of the project, about 250 candidates were identified as having a postal address that was unknown, who were nomadic people, or who were suffering in situations of such vulnerability that they had been rendered “invisible” to the system. Despite meeting all the eligibility requirements, these people would never have been aware of the pilot—and therefore would never have signed up—were it not for the intense effort made by the team of social workers assigned to the project who exhaustively localized and informed most of these “invisible” potential participants. Thus, a population that is usually “non-existent” to public administration was able to participate in a project that undoubtedly would be beneficial to them economically and relationally for 24 months. In most similar projects or experiments, the existence of the project is simply advertised, and potential participants are informed that they can sign up to participate. What the experience of Barcelona showed is that such an information strategy is highly inadequate, especially when the program or policy in question has the most excluded and vulnerable groups as its target population. This supports the criticism made by Castro and West when they emphasize that many social policies are designed under conceptual frameworks based on negative stereotypes and the stigmatization of the most vulnerable population—which, in the Spanish case, mostly applies to the gypsy, Roman, and nomadic population. This ultimately causes the details of the design and implementation of these policies to reinforce the dynamics of exclusion and stigmatization, and thus perpetuating many forms of discrimination and inequality. The phenomenon of low take-up rates is an example of this since, as a general rule, those who apply the least often for benefits or social policies are paradoxically the groups that are most vulnerable and excluded from these very circuits and programs of social protection. Again, the case of non-take-up or the compatibility with other public benefits should not seem to affect UBI due to its unconditional and universal nature. Although this may initially appear to be the case, the problem is that we do not have the empirical evidence to show that UBI would circumvent all these (or other similar) problems. In fact, we must be very cautious, because the examples of Stockton, Barcelona or Iran warn that there are always fundamental “details” that can raise questions not only about the viability of social policies but, above all, about their ethical and moral implications. These “details” should concern us because we know that being excluded from a benefit that one is entitled to is not so much a result of rational, individual decisions as it is the obstacles that are created by the very functioning of public administrations and the communications strategies they employ. It is morally uncontroversial for a person in a vulnerable situation to decide not to apply for a benefit. But that they do ultimately not apply for it because they have been inadequately informed, because they do not understand the application form, because this form can only be obtained from an office at a certain time, or because they lack the language or digital skills needed to fill out the paperwork online, is an unacceptable fact that challenges us and should make us reflect on what kind of society we live and desire to live in. We can focus our attention on the profile of some particular groups and continue to ask ourselves why they do not apply for a benefit that “we have so carefully designed for them,” but I believe it is more efficient, more effective, and above all more honest, to devote this attention to analyzing how our welfare states, our social policies, and our public institutions work. UBI experiments provide us with an incomparable opportunity to carry out this exercise of collective reflection. Let us not squander it.

Although nearly all social groups agree that stronger economic growth would contribute most to solving the unemployment problem, the prospects for a return to the conditions prevailing before 1973 are poor. The article argues that a general saturation, demographic developments and environmental problems may cause bottlenecks for economic growth. Important changes in the labour supply and in the sectoral distribution of employment are eroding the full-time, full-year concept. In addition, advances in information technology make it imperative to re-examine the old concept of full employment. A new full employment concept is proposed that includes a legal right to a basic amount of employment, i.e. at least part-time employment, combined with a right to a (partial) basic income.

-5.338602,-24.178095,0,"The present study examined the historical basis of the Australian disability income support system from 1908 to 2007. Although designed as a safety net for people with a disability, the disability income support system within Australia has been highly targeted. The original eligibility criteria of permanently incapacitated for work, medical criteria and later partially capacitated for work potentially contained ideological inferences that permeated across the time period. This represents an important area for study given the potential consequence for disability income support to marginalise people with a disability.

Social policy and disability policy theorists, including Saunders (2007, Social Policy Research Centre [SPRC]) and Gibilisco (2003) have provided valuable insight into some of the effects of disability policy and poverty. Yet while these theorists argued for some form of income support they did not propose a specific form of income security for further exploration. Few studies have undertaken a comprehensive review of the history of disability income support within the Australian context. This thesis sought to redress these gaps by examining disability income support policy within Australia. The research design consisted of an in-depth critical historical-comparative policy analysis methodology. The use of critical historical-comparative policy analysis allowed the researcher to trace the construction of disability within the Australian disability income support policy across four major historical epochs. A framework was developed specifically to guide analysis of the data. The critical discourse analysis method helped to understand the underlying ideological dimensions that led to the predominance of one particular approach over another. Given this, the research purpose of the study centred on: 

i. Tracing the history of the Australian disability income support system.
ii. Examining the historical patterns and ideological assumptions over time.
iii. Exploring the historical patterns and ideological assumptions underpinning an alternative model (Basic Income) and the extent to which each model promotes the social citizenship of people with a disability.

The research commitment to a social-relational ontology and the quest for social change centred on the idea that   has to be a better way in the provision of disability income support. This theme of searching for an alternative reality in disability income support policy resonated throughout the thesis. This thesis found that the Australian disability income support system is disabling in nature and generates categories of disability on the basis of ableness. From the study, ableness became a condition for citizenship. This study acknowledged that, in reality, income support provision reflects only one aspect of the disabling nature of society which requires redressing. Although there are inherent tensions in any redistributive strategy, the Basic Income model potentially provides an alternative to the Australian disability income support system, given its grounding in social citizenship. The thesis findings have implications for academics, policy-makers and practitioners in terms of developing better ways to understand disability constructs in disability income support policy. The thesis also makes a contribution in terms of promoting income support policies based on the rights of all people, not just a few.",,"Australia's disabling income support system : tracing the history of the Australian disability income support system 1908 to 2007 : disablism, citizenship and the basic income proposal"

20.067396,-32.52161,0,"During the era after the Second World War, Sweden has built a welfare system based on labor market participation and income maintenance. Low unemployment and decent wages are supposed to guarantee people a labor market income or income maintenance, which in turn should provide a proper standard for everyone. However, a rapid increase in unemployment and economic problems have made the future of the Swedish welfare state more uncertain than ever. These circumstances have, among other things, led to the suggestion that Sweden should abandon the income maintenance policy and create a social policy system with the more limited ambition of guaranteeing everyone a minimum income. In that case, one central question must be answered: what constitutes a decent minimum income in today's Sweden? Where should we draw the poverty line under which people will not be forced to live? These questions are central in the current debate. The consensual poverty line method is used in this article to derive a poverty line relevant for today's Sweden. The results shows that more than every fifth household has an income below the consensual poverty line. That is, they have an income that most Swedes would argue is too low to make ends meet. The level of the consensual poverty line was compared with the National Board of Health and Welfare's guidelines for social assistance. The consensual poverty line was shown to be more generous to small households and the norm for social assistance was more generous to larger households. Finally, the expenditure for guaranteeing all Swedish household a minimum income equal to the consensual poverty line was estimated: more than SEK 25 billion per year. The results in the article casts serious doubt on the ability of the Swedish welfare state to secure a decent income to all citizens.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2397.1995.tb00097.x,Making ends meet: perceptions of poverty in Sweden

15.45099,-4.2282796,4,"The aim of this chapter is to discuss how the introduction of basic income (henceforth BI) would influence the evaluation and gendered distribution of care work, and especially paid care work. Providing an income to all its members on an individual basis, without means-test or the requirement to be in the labor market, BI offers every citizen access to a guaranteed income, regardless of marital or employment status. Despite the fundamental and universal importance of care, the responsibility of providing care and the necessity of receiving care have not been sufficiently recognized and rewarded during the development of welfare states. Providing care has been further problematized as during this development, eligibility for social security benefits has been connected to the employment status of claimants. It is expected, and is sometimes hoped, that BI will to some extent untangle the links between welfare and labor and enhance the recognition and valuation of a wide variety of unpaid activities, including care work, which are currently carried out mostly unpaid and largely by women. It is also expected that BI will address the problem of undervaluation of paid care work in the labor market. But what kind of impacts would BI as an innovative scheme for providing income guarantee have on care work?

Developments in social security outlays and recipient numbers over the last two decades are compared with those occurring since 1983, in order that the nature and impact of recent policies introduced to increase targeting can be identified. The analysis indicates that increases in recipient numbers have been the dominant factor underlying the past growth in social security expenditure. The distinction between selectivity and targeting of income support provisions is then explained with reference to the concepts of eligibility and entitlement. A framework is developed to illustrate how recent policies have restrained the growth in social security recipient numbers by policies which have increased income support targeting. These moves have not always produced a consistently more selective system of income support, an issue which is explored with the use of an index of the degree of selectivity of social security expenditures developed specifically for this purpose.",,Selectivity and Targeting in Income Support: The Australian Experience
-23.568983,-14.017946,2,"Unconditional basic income (BI) is a proposal to reform social welfare
provision under which every member of society would be entitled to an income above subsistence level without means test or work requirement. The advantages of BI are that it effectively reduces poverty and increases the real freedom of citizens. However, by abolishing the necessity to work on the individual level BI policies are also inherently risky since they fundamentally change incentive structures. It is clearly possible that BI is fiscally infeasible in this sense that not enough people would engage in productive efforts on the basis of which a BI could then be distributed. Social science is to date unable to say how likely an outcome this is. From the perspective of BI supporters this state of affairs is suboptimal since the burden of proof on the feasibility of BI is widely perceived to fall on them. Basic income social experiments (BISE) are a very useful tool for meeting this strategic challenge. This is, firstly, because they are the best available method for generating knowledge on the consequences of a radically new programme such as BI. However, despite all methodological sophistication the social sciences can reduce but never eliminate the uncertainty regarding the consequences of BI, including fiscal feasibility. Secondly, BISE are useful because they help to overcome the discursive impasse which results from the fundamental lack of knowledge. BISE would help to move the currently stuck debate and – most importantly – show great promise for shifting the burden of proof back to the defendants of the status quo. Lastly, this paper finds ethical objections to BISE to be insubstantial and ascertains the feasibility of BISE in the German context.

The problem social policy makers face in fighting unemployment is that the social minimum must be kept at a reasonable level, large scale unemployment (especially at the lower end of the labour market) must be reduced, under the restriction that whatever policy measures are taken, there must remain sufficient (overall) incentives to work. Advocates of a BI assert that if we want to maintain the social minimum at a reasonable level, and at the same time want to reduce large scale unemployment at the lower end of the labour market (through gradually abolishing minimum wages and strenthening monetary incentives to work by eliminating the poverty trap), we inevitably move towards a BI-type scheme. I will therefore concentrate on what are probably the two most important adverse side-effects of the present welfare state: firstly, the poverty trap and secondly, unemployment at the bottom end of the labour market due to binding minimum wages.

These models frequently assume a steady growth in population. However, present and projected population dynamics are characterized by very large changes in the age struture of the population. Governmental and private projection models used for analysis of government policies for social security and other age-determined transfer programs do rely on the current population projections, but they assume independence of future economic growth from the retirement system. Moreover, none of these models are formulated in a way that makes them operational for studying the numerous dynamic trade-offs and relative possibilities inherent in income transfer programs. Such information is central in striving to attain simultaneously the socially desirable goals of maintaining or improving the standards of living of both the working and retired populations and of maintaining an equitable and stable intergenerational transfer system. This paper proposes such an operationally implementable method of analysis empolying the new approach of goal focusing, derived from ideas of goal programming and efficient point analysis.",,A Goal Focusing Approach to Analysis of Intergenerational Transfers of Income: Theoretical Development and Preliminary Results.

There remains the transition from the philosophy to the economics of basic income, which allows considering it as a precise alternative of negative income tax.

If public works primarily displace unemployment, foregone earnings will be negligible.   However, displacement of other income-generating activities will represent a pecuniary opportunity cost to participation in the scheme, thereby reducing the net income benefits of the program.   The evidence from India suggests that the pecuniary opportunity cost to public works participants is, in fact, low.   This result emerges most clearly in the relatively poor village of Shirapur, where participation in the program is also more widespread.   Overall, the public works program in India does appear to generate sizable net income gains to participants, ranging from 7 percent to 10 percent in the villages studies.

EnglishIn recent years, the economic literature has highlighted the rising employment risks related to technological change. On the comparative political economy side, exposure to labor market risks has been investigated as a source of preferences for redistribution, but technological change has not been so far framed as a distinctive risk. In this work, we empirically test the hypothesis whereby exposure to a relatively high individual risk of technological unemployment translates into higher support for redistributive policies, which is a precondition for the emergence of political demand for policies geared at protecting workers from lack of income as a consequence of technological change. We test our hypothesis on Italy, using data from Round 8 of the European Social Survey, including unique data on support for minimum income schemes (GMI) alongside universal basic income (UBI), and a measure of subjective (perceived) risk of technological unemployment alongside an objective one based on tasks substitutability (the Routine Task Index). Our results show that higher levels of objective exposure to risk of technological unemployment significantly correlate with support for some income protection measures, GMI in particular, irrespective of perception of such risk. On the one hand, this points to the possible emergence of political demand independent of other risk factors such as labor market status or exposure to globalization. On the other hand, it raises the issue of causal mechanisms (such as social and occupational networks) that translate objective risks in policy preferences. Finally, our results highlight the relevance of a notion of distributive deservingness for popular support of redistributive policies, consistently with the overall functioning logic of the Italian welfare state.",,Esposizione al rischio di disoccupazione tecnologica e politiche

8.794902,-17.274986,0,"Progressive scholars have been strongly critical of conservative trends in the design and administration of public assistance programs in market societies, but it is far from clear what they would propose instead. Believing that it takes something to replace something, this article assess two different progressive strategies for eliminating poverty and promoting individual freedom that could serve as replacements for existing public assistance regimes. The first proposal is that all members of society be guaranteed an unconditional basic income without imposing any work requirements in exchange for the benefit. Such a benefit could be provided either in the form of an unconditional grant paid to all members of society (the form preferred by most advocates of the idea) or a negative income tax. Supporters of this strategy have suggested that a basic income guarantee set at or above the poverty level could replace not only the means-tested public assistance regime that is the principal target of the proposal, but most other government transfer programs as well. The proposal also is promoted as a solution to the problem of unemployment, a means of compensating the many millions of people (mostly women) who perform unpaid family care and community service work, and as a way of enhancing individual freedom and personal development. The second proposal is an updated version of the social welfare strategy that dominated progressive thinking in market societies from the end of World War II through the mid 1970s. In its earlier incarnation, this strategy combined the use of Keynesian macroeconomic policy to 2 achieve full employment with the use of social insurance programs to guarantee income security for individuals or families that were either unable or not expected to be self-supporting. The version of this strategy considered in this article would be similar except that it would supplement continuing efforts to achieve full employment in the regular labor market with the use of direct job creation by government to close any remaining job gap – thereby insuring the availability of enough jobs to provide decent paid employment for all job seekers. I refer to this as the employment assurance strategy in deference to New Deal social welfare planners who first proposed it in the United States. The cost of these two strategies of eliminating poverty in the United States is compared along with their relative merits in achieving other progressive goals. In undertaking the latter evaluation, the economic and social provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are used as an assessment criterion. The principal conclusions drawn are that the basic income strategy would be far more expensive than the employment assurance strategy, that it would not provide an adequate substitute for securing the right to work recognized in the Universal Declaration, and that most of the other benefits the basic income strategy would produce could be more fully achieved at lower cost by using the employment assurance strategy combined with conventional social insurance. On the other hand, it is argued that a targeted basic income guarantee could make a valuable contribution to the employment assurance strategy, and one version of such a benefit",,Is There A Progresssive Alternative To Conservative Welfare Reform

As UBI implies a much larger EU budget and a redistribution of collected budget revenues, the chance of introducing UBI depends on the required redistribution – the larger the redistribution, the lower the chance. The chance is indirectly assessed by an exercise in which 50 percent of actual tax revenues generated by indirect taxes of member states is collected at the center and distributed equally to all citizens. Though the net costs to the rich are relatively modest, the results indicate that the idea of introducing UBI on the European level is an illusion.",https://doi.org/10.1515/danb-2015-0010,The Revenue Side of a Universal Basic Income in the EU and Euro Area

1.3075362,42.685455,4,"Degrowth scholars and other growth skeptics have done a considerable amount of important work exposing the many defects inherent to the dominant macroeconomics of growth (Kallis, 2011; Latouche 2009; Jackson 2009; Victor 2008; Daly 1996). In recent years a growing body of literature has also emerged exploring what structural changes could be undertaken to facilitate the emergence of a degrowth or steady-state economy (Alexander 2011a, Jackson 2009; Hamilton 2003). Very little has been written, however, on what role social or cultural evolution may need to play in providing the necessary preconditions for such structural change. The neglect of this issue is problematic for two main reasons. First, it seems highly unlikely that a degrowth or steady-state economy will ever arise voluntarily within cultures generally comprised of individuals seeking ever-higher levels of income and consumption (Hamilton and Denniss, 2005). Accordingly, before growth economics can be overcome, this significant cultural obstacle must be acknowledged, confronted, and somehow transcended. Secondly, even if notions of degrowth or steady-state economics were to gain widespread acceptance within a culture, it seems highly unlikely that a degrowth or steady-state economy would arise voluntarily unless people had some idea of what needed to be done at the personal and community levels to bring about such an economy (Trainer, 2010; Hopkins, 2008). In other words, it is not enough merely to offer a critique of existing structures of growth; it is equally important to explore the question of how one ought to live in opposition to those structures. This paper engages some aspects of these complex issues by looking into what role social movements may have to play in creating the preconditions needed for a degrowth or steady-state economy to materialize.

10.921565,-4.1378307,4,"In a 2017 interview, Microsoft founder Bill Gates recommended taxing robots to slow the pace of automation. Funds raised could be used to retrain and financially support displaced workers. Up to 47 per cent of US jobs are at risk by advancements in artificial intelligence. Low-wage workers currently hold a majority of those at-risk jobs. Increased automation is likely to exacerbate income inequality. While employment changes due to automation are not new, advances in artificial intelligence threaten to eliminate many more jobs than were eliminated historically through automation. Accelerated automation presents two problems: a revenue problem and a human problem. The revenue problem exists because the tax system is designed to tax labour more heavily than capital, as labour is less likely to be able to avoid taxation. Capital investment, on the other hand, is taxed more lightly because capital is mobile and can escape taxation. When capital becomes labour, as in automation, the bottom falls out of the system. The human problem is first that most people need income from working to survive. Some scholars have advocated for a governmentally provided universal basic income (UBI). Taxing robots could in theory provide revenue for a UBI, although any source of revenue would work just as well. While a UBI would solve the survival problem, humans need more than basic survival. In his classic work, psychologist Abraham Maslow listed survival as the foundation of his hierarchy of needs. Work satisfies the higher order needs of social identity and self-esteem. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ), enacted in December 2017, significantly cut the US corporate tax rate, from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. In addition, TCJA increased tax benefits for purchasing equipment (which would include automation) by significantly enhancing bonus depreciation. The new tax legislation continued and deepened the existing tax bias towards automation.

Next, we show in this paper how the community can maintain self-sovereignty over the economy, by transferring the role of minting money to the hands of every registered member of the community. Such minting serves both as the origin point of sovereignty over the economy, as well as a form of universal basic income. 
Yet, a distributed construction of an online community which is bigger than the reach of personal acquaintances is strongly susceptible to sybils. This paper assumes that the community has some means for occasionally exposing sybils. It then shows, based on this assumption, that there are means to balance back the economy such that all money minted by sybils is eventually retrieved and liquidated, so that - asymptotically - the amount of money minted equals the number of genuine identities, multiplied by the amount of time they were minting. Furthermore, we argue that this approach can serve as an incentive mechanism that deters the creation of sybils and incentivizes sybil hunting.",,Sybil Resilient Money Minting.

-30.192926,-20.741732,2,"By 1967, some form of negative income tax was viewed as a leading policy candidate to provide an effective poverty reduction strategy for the U.S., but concerns about work incentives and the administration of an unconditional cash transfer of this kind led to proposals for a series of scientific experiments rather than a full-blown basic income plan. This chapter reviews the issues and lessons associated with the design, implementation and analysis of the four income maintenance experiments conducted in a tightly woven time frame in the U.S. between 1969 and 1975. While the experiments eventually provided evidence of relatively small work disincentive effects, those results were too late and too poorly understood to help Nixon’s Family Assistance Plan, a negative income tax proposal, which failed in the U.S. Senate.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-66085-7_3,The Age of Negative Income Tax Experimentation (the 70s)

Decisions about a UBI should come in conjunction with decisions about its financing, as alternative financing options can have quite different macroeconomic, fiscal, and distributional effects that could reinforce or offset those of the UBI. Those effects would reflect a range of economic, demographic, social, and institutional factors that will likely prove highly country specific.

Only two countries—Mongolia and the Islamic Republic of Iran—had a national UBI in place for a short period of time. Subnational experiences, such as Alaska’s, provide valuable insights, but these remain constrained in one or more features. The large majority of UBI pilots prove variants of targeted, quasi-UBI schemes, which lack true UBI program design features—all in cash, no conditions, and no targeting. Policy makers must (1) have a clear understanding of the current tax and transfer system in a given context; (2) identify a specific UBI objective; (3) compare UBI to the existing system in light of coverage, level of progressivity, adequacy of transfers, household incentives and behavioral responses, costs, financing options, political economy, and delivery; and (4) carefully weigh the scope, expected performance, and trade-offs involved.

A procedure that simulates the households’ choices under given tax-transfer rules is then embedded in a constrained optimization program in order to identify optimal rules under the public budget constraint. The optimality criterion is the class of Kolm’s social welfare function. The tax-transfer rules considered as candidates are members of a class that includes as special cases various versions of the Negative Income Tax: Conditional (means-tested) Basic Income, Unconditional Basic Income, In-Work Benefits and General Negative Income Tax, combined with a Flat Tax above the exemption level. The analysis in most cases show that: the General Negative Income Tax strictly dominates the other rules, including the current ones; the Unconditional Basic Income policy is better than the Conditional Basic Income policy; Conditional Basic Income policy may lead to a significant reduction in labour supply and poverty-trap effects; In-Work-Benefit policy is strictly dominated by the General Negative Income Tax and by the Unconditional Basic Income.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3183167,The Case for NIT FT in Europe.

It is essential to expand education and training so that, in an increasingly knowledge intensive society, everyone has a chance of skilled and fulfilling work. Job guarantee schemes may be less suited for a highly differentiated workforce in a complex economy. A guaranteed basic income is an important proposal that allows for freedom of agency and individual choice. Prominent criticisms of a basic income are rebutted. The alternative proposal of an expansion of basic services is also worthy of some experimentation, but there would be problems in over-reliance on state bureaucracy. Thomas Paine’s proposal for taxes on inheritance combined with grants to individuals reaching the age of maturity is still relevant and commendable. Other forms of wealth tax, including a land tax, should also be considered.

What is it meant to achieve? How do we know, and what don’t we know, about its performance? What does it take to implement it in practice? Drawing from global evidence, literature, and survey data, this volume provides a framework to elucidate issues and trade-offs in UBI with a view to help inform choices around its appropriateness and feasibility in different contexts. Specifically, the book examines how UBI differs from or complements other social assistance programs in terms of objectives, coverage, incidence, adequacy, incentives, effects on poverty and inequality, financing, political economy, and implementation. It also reviews past and current country experiences, surveys the full range of existing policy proposals, provides original results from micro–tax benefit simulations, and sets out a range of considerations around the analytics and practice of UBI.",,Exploring Universal Basic Income

Reading that book, one feels the deep-rooted reasons that move men to conquer the earth, that produce families, and great and lasting races. One also sees clearly, and that is why I remember the book, the phenomena of labour, wages, profit and saving not obscured by monetary superstructures or verbal conventions. The land stretches out vast, without limits, before the eyes of the pioneer, but covered with firs, pines, scrubs and bushes of every kind, without roads, but crossed by rivers and buried for seven months of the year under a thick blanket of snow and ice.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230522978_16,On the Source of Saving and the Taxation of Normal Income as an Approximation of the Exclusion of Income from the Tax Base

I came to these ideas via the issue of effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) that was raging at both ends of the income scale. The loudest, public, and most forceful arguments were being made by the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University who were demanding a maximum rate of 39 percent, the same as the then company tax rate (Centre of Policy Studies, 1988). Quieter and less publicized voices (especially from Peter Saunders and the University of New South Wales Centre for Social Policy Research) were putting forward the obvious point that the highest effective marginal tax rates were suffered by low-income workers for whom the tapering of a range of welfare payments could drive the effective marginal tax rates well over 100 percent without even taking into account the costs of going to work (including child care).",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137535320_7,Paying for a Basic Income

Workfare rejects unconditional rights of social citizenship, which formed the basis of social democratic political reforms and advocacy throughout the twentieth century.

This paper addresses four egalitarian arguments for workfare: the arguments from recipient self-respect, rational paternalism, fair reciprocity, and equal opportunity for active citizenship.

This liberal vision is best fulfilled, Hayek argues, by a market economy where the government has a monopoly on the legitimate exercise of coercion and where its actions are constrained by the rule of law. In the realm of welfare provision, he argues that this framework allows government to provide only a limited safety net. Though “[m]any scholars view The Constitution of Liberty to be F. A.

By studying a number of proposals for reforming the income maintenance system—both those that have succeeded, and those that have failed—we can list the factors involved in the political process. A categorisation of factors is attempted so that we can then ask whether a study of the factors that relate to so far unsuccessful reform proposals might enable us to predict the circumstances in which those proposals might succeed. The current somewhat challenging policy context will then be studied to see whether it might match the circumstances required for the success of any of the reform proposals studied.

The attributes that characterizes basic income in the media are mostly negative and there is no discussion where work strategy and basic income is seriously spoken of.

The figuration of basic income in these media is characterised mostly by negative and depreciatory attributes. This makes the story of basic income to something that is unrealistic, unjust, immoral and only for lazy people.

3.1780314,32.43969,4,"Conceptualizing the “Right” to Avoid Origin Deprivation: International Law and Domestic Implementation By Alice Diver A proclamation of a right is not the fulfillment of a right any more than an airplane schedule is a flight. A proclamation may or may not be an initial step toward the fulfilment of the right listed. It is frequently the substitute of the promise in the place of the fulfilment. —Henry Shue, Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U. S. Foreign Policy Introduction As Jack Donnelly has suggested, at the level of domestic implementation, “identity is entitled to protection only where it is an autonomous expression of the rights and values of those who carry it” (214). Although there are no explicit rights to avoid origin deprivation (“genetic non-ancestry”) within international law, a number of related entitlements to access certain aspects of genetic identity do appear to exist. These include such ostensibly justiciable concepts as the right to possess a name1 or nationality,2 and the duty upon states to respect “cultural integrity.”3 Broader, normative principles such as the best interests of the child,4 equality of treatment and non-discrimination5 also merit discussion here, given that they are often either embedded in domestic legislation or have provided useful guidance for domestic proceedings.6 This article will attempt to conceptualize as a basic human right the hypothetical right to avoid origin deprivation. The existence of such a right, or rather the need for such a right to be more fully articulated and more consistently implemented by domestic legal systems, is underpinned by the considerable amount of research highlighting the wide range of harms that can attach to genetic kinlessness. This article will ask whether such a right might yet be found to carry sufficient weight to “embed” itself as usefully juridical concept within the sphere of domestic child law, especially where private law issues such as family formation, information release, kin contact, or welfare paramountcy arise. Arguably, domestic interpretations of many socio-economic entitlements, such as the right to respect for family life, Adoption & Culture 3 (2012) 142 are often almost entirely resource-dependant, and therefore tend to be viewed more as privileges than as fully justiciable human rights. The “right” to receive information or to be afforded socio-cultural heritage protections are key examples (Colliver, et al.; and Marks).7 This article also makes particular reference to one closed records jurisdiction (Québec) where the rights of many adoptees have been almost completely overruled by the use of non-disclosure vetoes on the basis of protecting the juridically heavier interests of natal parents. This is so despite the enactment of two regional charters aimed at the incorporation of basic human rights, and in spite of the scrutiny of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. Committee Country Reports are referred to here with a view to gauging whether the guidance contained in them might eventually persuade domestic jurists and policy-makers that origin deprivation ought to occur exceptionally rather than normatively as a consequence of social kinship. Essentially, if identity rights in international law engender a corresponding right to “repatriate” with one’s genitors, this raises the possibility that a number of rights infringements might have arisen in respect of donor anonymity, closed birth records, and non-disclosure vetoes. If one accepts that the “universal protection of relationships with significant others is in fact protection of the distinctness and the uniqueness in the individual,” then it may be difficult to justify the complete loss of genetic connection as a means to enabling social kinship (Ronen 151). The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Ratification of the Convention may nevertheless encourage domestic reform. —Barbara Stark, International Family Law: An Introduction Ronen has described The Children’s Convention as “the most authoritative legal text on children in international law,” enshrining as it does the primacy of child welfare (148). Michael Freeman has further argued that it represents a “celebration of children’s rights [which] has reached a crescendo” (273).

I argue against such ‘UBI-first’ approaches. Compared to UBI proposals for other purposes, a UBI sufficient or near-sufficient for minimising domination at work would be especially demanding in two ways. First, the level of the grant would be more demanding compared to UBIs suitable for other purposes, in order for workers to be able to credibly threaten to leave their jobs. Secondly, the maintenance of the grant must also meet strict criteria. The demanding level of the grant must be effectively secured against reduction, allowing workers to plan on its long-term acceptability; and in order to avoid increased state domination it must assume the status of an entitlement rather than a gift that may be withdrawn, through stabilisation against political change or some other means. These difficulties render UBI-first approaches doubtful at best, and an unhelpful distraction from other, more fruitful strategies at worst.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11158-020-09487-9,"Work, Domination, and the False Hope of Universal Basic Income"

Who would argue with that? Taking a closer look, however, there is much uncertainty as to what exactly is meant and how a UBI should work and be financed.

For example a study for the United Nations Development Programme proposed this for the world’s three billion poorest people. But this would be neither universal nor sufficient – in average US$ 2.50 per person per day. In the paper there is also a positive reference to Spain, where a ‘basic income’ was introduced. There it concerns however an even worse Spanish variant of the German model of basic security for needy unemployed (‘Hartz IV’), which is criticised by the trade unions as too low and too repressive. UBI as a rescue against the crisis? For Germany this discussion makes little sense. This is a country with a highly developed social welfare system, which showed its performance in the ongoing crisis – despite of all problems and legitimate criticisms. This system is characterised by social insurance schemes, which involve the vast majority of the population – in particular, dependent employees and their families – which provide benefits on the basis of contributions paid. Especially, the short-time work allowance saved millions from falling into unemployment. But nevertheless many mini-jobbers, self-employed and small entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit. They often have low incomes anyway and need every euro, but do not receive short-time work benefits or unemployment benefits because they are not covered by unemployment insurance. If they are needy, they can apply for basic security, but this is below the German poverty line. For the German UBI community this is rather a deterrent example, they see a ‘real UBI’ as the fundamental alternative to this means-tested basic provision. A UBI as they mean it is intended to be an income that the government pays unconditionally to each person, regardless of what income that person receives or what assets they possess. There is no means testing and each person receives the same amount (only children less). The UBI should be high enough to cover basic needs and guarantee social participation. The search for gainful employment would not be required. As a response to the Covid 19 crisis more than 400,000 people supported a petition that demands the introduction of an unconditional basic income of 800-1200 euro per person and month in Germany for 6 months. This would cost about 500 billion euro, which would be 3 or 4 times the complete public expenditure on education. But why should everyone receive such an unconditional basic income (BGE) as a measure against the crisis, although for many, fortunately the majority of employees, the income is not at all lost, but continues as before? For the majority of the employees hit by the crisis the short-time work allowance or even the unemployment benefit is better than such a UBI would be. On the other hand, such an UBI would not be a rescue for the many self-employed and small businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy because their income is lost but they still have to pay various running costs, rents, etc. Targeted aid for those who need it would also make more economic sense so that they can get started again after the crisis. And this would be far less expensive because far fewer people than the entire population would receive it. Arguments against demands for a UBI In principle, the various arguments that speak against a UBI also apply to a corona crisis UBI. Why should the vast majority of the population receive this money, although they do not need it at all? Why should everyone get the same amount, no matter how high their...",https://doi.org/10.1353/iur.2020.a838153,Universal Basic Income - not really an alternative

However, by the end of the twentieth century, as a result of the changing family reforms and labour market patterns, leave arrangements had become a major policy issue with debates concentrating on entitlement, length of leave, and income support. This chapter discusses the development of leave policies, specifically parental leave in the Netherlands. This development has involved different interpretations of the purpose of leave and the divisions of responsibilities between the government, parents, and social partners. Starting from the view point in which parental leave was seen as a way to facilitate part-time employment, the Parental Leave Act provided a basic entitlement to take part-time, unpaid leave for a short period of time. It was left to the social partners to supplement this minimum. However, over time, public responsibility for leave has increased. This was evident not only in the increasing number of leave policies, but in the growing public involvement in the provision of income support as well. During this process, the interpretation of parental leave appeared to have changed from a labour market instrument into a more complex instrument intended to facilitate parenthood and the well-being of children.",https://doi.org/10.56687/9781847427779-014,The Netherlands: bridging labour and care

We believe that the application of schemes based on selectivity and reciprocity to a significant portion of the population undermines the basic characteristics of the Welfare State, i.e. class stabilisation policies and the universal basis of treatment.

In the 1930s and 1940s, programs were initiated to reduce unemployment and improve social security as part of the “New Deal.” In the late 1960s, somewhat comparable to the U. S. at that time, Germany’s new government started its own “New Deal.” Unemployment was modest but the growth of the economy was declining. The German government wanted to implement programs in order to follow a path of steady growth. Since most of the programs were evaluated, a growing market of evaluation could be observed at that time. For several reasons, the government lost sight of this steady path. Only four decades later, four million unemployed convinced the administration under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in early 2000 that something had to fundamentally change. A second “New Deal” (New Deal II) was initiated; labour market reforms were agreed on and implemented. As a result, the bureau of labour was transformed into a service agency with the core task of placement. Additionally, unemployment payment and social welfare were eliminated. The basic idea was to create an activating social system (aktivierender Sozialstaat) that supported the unemployed but at the same time also placed more demands on them (BMWI, 2008, p. 16). The corresponding laws are linked to the name Hartz, a consultant to Chancellor Schroeder and manager of Volkswagen (VW) at that time. The intended and unintended effects of these reforms were widely discussed in the press, making many aware of evaluation and leaving them with the impression of a growing evaluation market.

In that view, social integration implies more than the workplace has to offer. While gainful employment based on high standards of social security may further the cause of social integration, precarious jobs combined with harsh workfare regimes do endanger it. Concluding, a policy adhering to the capability approach towards social integration is proposed, measures intended to take pressure offthe welfare system include changes in the system of public education and the establishment of a basic income scheme.",https://doi.org/10.14315/zee-2006-0129,Erwerbsarbeit und gesellschaftliche Integration

Yet many environmentalists are opposed to limitless growth on the grounds that it is ecologically unsustainable.   In particular, the ‘degrowth’ movement that has recently emerged in Northern Europe has challenged the paradigm of growth, promoting instead an alternative agenda of reducing production and consumption in order to attain sustainability and social justice. Yet, ironically, the rise of the degrowth movement has coincided with a severe economic recession in the wealthier countries and the result of this does, indeed, seem to have increased hardship and inequity as businesses collapse and jobs are lost (e.g. see JRF, 2012).   This situation forces us to consider whether degrowth is feasible in a market economy, which appears to depend on growth – and, if not, what this tells us about the macro-policies necessary to become an equal, just, and at the same time, ecological, society.

A Radical Proposal for a Free Society and a Sane Economy, Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght table two arguments that focus explicitly on the European Union. Their first argument concerns strategies to introduce basic income at the national level: VPV to cope with the threat of selective immigration, the sustainability of national basic income imposes ‘firm limits on hospitality’. The second argument concerns the introduction of a pan-European basic income: VPV to support this claim, I sketch a normative framework with regard to free movement and non-discrimination. My second claim concerns VP&V’s case for pan-European basic income. If it is true that the EU’s principal justice-related problem is that European integration has diminished core capabilities of national welfare states, such as national redistribution and national stabilization, without adequately ensuring their functioning at a higher level, the remedies to that problem are essentially different from a pan-European basic income. My third claim concerns both national basic income and pan-European basic income. The starting point of VP&V’s case for basic income is compelling: we all benefit from a common inheritance, for which none of us did anything.

The dominance of cash in the economic inequality discourse leads inexorably to (perhaps well-intentioned) policies to reduce personal taxation for lower income households and to increase their cash incomes, including the recently popular idea of an unconditional Universal Basic Income. This paper argues that innovative direct solutions to the provision of various goods and services by alternative means tend to be squeezed out of the current discourse about economic inequality. Through analysis of the Minimum Essential Standard of Living, an argument is made that a more sophisticated social policy discourse is needed to tackle disparities in people’s material conditions, beyond a focus on cash income, in order to bring about the foundational conditions for a good society even in the context of low economic growth and/or fiscal austerity.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0269094218802987,"Economic inequality, social policy and a good society"

In a number of countries, such as Canada, Finland and the Netherlands, local experiments involving basic income have been taking place. This article addresses the main arguments for and against basic income. Some authors regard basic income as a populist and paternalist policy, which is an incorrect judgment, as its adequate implementation could lead to budgetary savings, reduce the size of government, and lower state interference in the lives of citizens. Another objection is that basic income would discourage labor and stimulate social dependency; however, local experiments in partial introduction of basic income and similar benefits have not confirmed this statement. The claim that basic income is too expensive of a measure does not consider that it is supposed to replace numerous other social benefits and would therefore most likely result in reduced administrative costs. Basic income is a social welfare measure most compatible with the nature of labor and the labor market under the technological revolution that has begun, where labor has been getting increasingly distributed and aimed at the workers’ self-realization rather than their survival. In practice, basic income is to be implemented gradually, only covering selected groups of individuals at first and expanding the range of recipients over time.

Nevertheless, the reasons for that support are not always clear and quite often not related to environmental issues. For this reason, two different approaches to a green BI – environmental and ecological – are discussed in this article. The first could be part of a green growth strategy, whereas the second would require structural changes to the economic model, in support of a post-productivist economy. Although showing some overlaps, these models are in conflict in some central aspects, such as the role of economic growth in promoting sustainability. For this reason, it might be incorrect to assume that an environmental BI is a step toward an ecological BI. We will focus on the green aspects as a consequence of implementing a BI and independently of its sources of funding – namely by looking into the amount a BI needs to be in order to support shifting activities from the market to the autonomous sphere – and on the green potential of its sources of financing.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2019-0026,"Environmentalism, Ecologism, and Basic Income"

This renewed conception has gone beyond its origins in the US unions in the 1970s to become a key element in many discourses worldwide, with different nuances. Over the last few years, it has found a place in the SDGs and gathered strong support from the ILO. As political frameworks and literature multiply, this work presents a systematic review of the concept, its evolution and the methodologies devoted to studying it. We make three major points. First, the empirical state-of-the-art has blurred the lines of the methodological classifications found in previous studies: CGE and IAMs are two of the most popular methods, with a growing interest in hybrid approaches and system dynamics. Additionally, while most studies focus on the national level, the regional level is gaining momentum to illustrate the asymmetric effects of the transition. Second, a certain consensus has been detected to point out a positive, yet relatively small, impact of the transition on net employment and a negative effect on income distribution. Third, there is a scarcity of research about income dynamics, while studies on labour are blind to the effects of the transition on the quality of jobs, the evolution of working hours and gender.

This is the first study made in Spain in calculating the lump sum of a basic social benefit for the whole population.

Basic income—a no-strings-attached cash transfer made to all citizens of a country, rich or poor—has been lauded as a plan to eliminate poverty, reduce income inequality, redress imbalances in the labor market, remedy the impending problem of mass technology-induced unemployment—the “robot apocalypse”—and make possible meaningful lives for those otherwise dependent on menial work in the labor market. It has also been proposed as an efficient, nonpaternalistic, and stigma-free alternative to existing welfare state policies. This Article compares basic income to an alternative policy proposal: the regulation of maximum working hours in the labor market. This Article contends that on nearly all of these virtues, working-time regulation does better than, or at least as well as, basic income. In particular, working-time regulation makes “free time” available to a broader array of individuals, also addresses technological unemployment, and is much more conducive to pro-environmental policies. Most importantly, it is more deeply egalitarian than basic income, not only addressing income inequality but social inequality, as well. Although basic income and working-time regulation are not necessarily incompatible—indeed some have advocated the adoption of both policies—there may be other factors that effectively render them policy substitutes. Specifically, not only is working-time regulation more complementary to existing welfare-state policy than is basic income, but—already in existence in the U.S. and most other developed countries—it also does not face the challenges of political and economic feasibility that confront basic income.

Critics point out that universality spreads limited resources thinly over the population limiting the impact on poverty for a given level of spending. While high income countries can claw back the transfer to the higher income group through a progressive income tax, this is not possible in developing countries where most people operate in the informal sector. This note looks at an alternative to either narrow targeting or UBI. It uses household survey data from 52 low and middle-income countries to compare the poverty impact of a UBI to a transfer that is gradually reduced as estimated consumption increases. The taper can be set at different rates and can lead to zero transfers to households above a chosen threshold. The tapered UBI (TUBI) can be based on proxy indicators for unobserved income from special surveys and administrative databases.

Its main message is supported: that we should now focus on settling the pensions phase of the system, moving on from the focus up until now on the accumulation phase. The Report provides evidence that optimal use of savings at the current 9.5% SG rate can deliver adequate retirement incomes to those on median incomes and below. But this assumes the savings will be used appropriately. Accordingly, any decision not to proceed with the legislated increases in the SG to 12% must have a quid pro quo: measures which address the outstanding problems in the pensions phase that are causing sub-optimal use of savings and leaving gaps for particular vulnerable groups.

Unfortunately, Callaghan is not very helpful about the solutions to these problems.

The paper examines the Report's suggested 'optimal use' of superannuation savings, suggesting it is not in fact practicable and proposing alternative drawdown arrangements to ensure adequate and secure retirement incomes. It also questions the Report's lack of support for simplifying the pension means test and for measures to improve support for vulnerable groups. It questions the Report's assessment of superannuation tax concessions and cautions against assumptions that there might be significant extra revenues available by more heavily taxing high income groups.

The work reveals the relevance of UBI concept development in the context of the need to overcome mass poverty in Russia. The result of the theoretical analysis shows that generally recognized UBI principles (universality, unconditionality, individual nature of monetary payments, their regularity) are justified by long-term trends in social policy evolution. The prospect of introducing universal basic income is presented as a qualitative transition (leap) in implementation of the latter. The social policy measures, closest to implementation of UBI principles, are characterized as its transitional forms including experiments on its introduction. To assess the practical feasibility of UBI transitional forms, the article uses the results of a survey of experts from different Russian regions conducted with the authors' participation and a pilot experiment and modeling of the results of UBI toolkit implementation. The paper proposes a possible scheme for implementing UBI tools in Russia, as well as pilot projects for low-income families with children, graduates of universities and secondary vocational educational institutions during the transition from study to the first place of work, the unstable employed (including the unemployed). The authors assess the paradox of activating the implementation of UBI principles in the context of the COVID-2019 pandemic under unfavorable financial conditions as confirming the reality of the prospects for its transitional forms for Russia.

-23.93614,21.606531,2,"Proponents and opponents of a universal basic income all acknowledge that the most significant political challenge to its adoption in the United States is that a universal basic income would not have a work requirement attached. Often, this is characterized as a problem involving incentives—the availability of a universal basic income would cause many people to stop working (or significantly curtail the number of hours that they work) and simply live off the universal basic income. This Article makes three contributions to the literature related to a universal basic income: First, it provides a typology for understanding the many reasons for valuing work; second, it argues that the United States is unlikely to implement a universal basic income because a universal basic income does not account for several aspects of the value of work; and, third, it argues that advocates of a universal basic income should instead focus on the more modest goal of redefining the activities that constitute work and broadening the social safety net by expanding existing policies through the use of a broader definition of work. This Article proposes that the value of work in American political culture has four primary dimensions: 1) reciprocity, that one receives rewards for one’s labor, that one gets what one gives and that no one should be a free rider, one who gets but does not give; 2) calling or vocation, that work is a calling or vocation that one should have or pursue, and that only those that have or pursue such a calling or vocation have moral standing; 3) self sufficiency, that work promotes self sufficiency, which is a necessary component of liberty and which is necessary to avoid dependency; and 4) incentives, of an economic kind, that society should encourage work because it increases the size of the economic pie. These categories provide a new framework for thinking about the value of work and for evaluating policies that relate to the working lives of Americans. As an alternative to the adoption of a universal basic income, this Article proposes that proponents of a universal basic income should focus on expanding and redefining current policies, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit so that they more closely resemble a participation income. In fact, a broader definition of work has even been used in recent conservative policy ideas, such as the Medicaid work requirements that some states have introduced, which include within their definition of work the activities of education, job training, and community service. This Article closes with an outline of a proposal to adopt an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit that resembles a participation income and addresses each of the dimensions of the value of work.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3564492,Something for Nothing: Universal Basic Income and the Value of Work Beyond Incentives

This link between the state and the individual aims to finance public expenditures. In addition, within the scope of the social state concept, the state takes measures to increase individuals’ income or to eliminate income differences between individuals. Negative income tax is applied in order to improve the current situation of individuals who have income below the level determined within the scope of these measures. Negative income tax, which is frequently encountered in Western countries and is not sufficiently known in our country, is one of the auxiliary elements in the fair distribution of income and in the fight against poverty. Individuals below the income level determined by this system are assisted by providing additional income or exempting the government from the tax liability they have to pay and contributing directly or indirectly to their budgets. Thus, with the negative income tax, it is aimed to play an active role in the fight against poverty problem in the country and at least contribute to the improvement of the people’s living conditions. One of the aims of zakat in Islam is to reduce the problem of poverty and meet the basic needs of people to prepare the ground for a better life.

Early automation, the decline of labor unions, changes in corporate taxation, the financialization and globalization of the economy, deindustrialization in the U.S. and many OECD countries, and trade have contributed to these trends. However, the transformative roles of more recent automation and digital technologies/artificial intelligence (AI) are now considered by many as additional and potentially more potent forces undermining the ability of workers to maintain their foothold in the economy. These drivers of change are intensifying the extent to which advancing technology imbedded in increasingly productive real capital is driving productivity. To compound the problem, many solutions presented by industrialized nations to environmental problems rely on hyper-efficient technologies, which if fully implemented, could further advance the displacement of well-paid job opportunities for many. While there are numerous ways to address economic inequality, there is growing interest in using some form of universal basic income (UBI) to enhance income and provide economic stability. However, these approaches rarely consider the potential environmental impact from the likely increase in aggregate demand for goods and services or consider ways to focus this demand on more sustainable forms of consumption. Based on the premise that the problems of income distribution and environmental sustainability must be addressed in an integrated and holistic way, this paper considers how a range of approaches to financing a UBI system, and a complementary market solution based on an ownership-broadening approach to inclusive capitalism, might advance or undermine strategies to improve environmental sustainability.",,Universal basic income and inclusive capitalism: consequences for sustainability

It should be noted that two other survivors of the terrorist attack have published bandes dessinées or graphic albums: Catharsis, by Luz (Futuropolis, 2015), and La légèreté, by Catherine Meurisse (Dargaud, 2016). Edward Ousselin Western Washington University Andrew Yang The War on Normal People: The Truth about America’s Disappearing Jobs and Why Universal Basic Income Is Our Future New York. Hachette. 2018. 284 pages. The case for universal basic income (UBI)—whereby the state makes regular, unconditional income payments to all its working-age citizens—is gaining increasing traction in the United States. Though the concept of UBI is nothing new to American politics, it has acquired renewed relevance in the face of a pressing modern issue: the automation of jobs. Andrew Yang makes one of the more noteworthy arguments in favor of UBI in his urgent new book, The War on Normal People. Yang is clearly a man of action. He is the founder of Venture for America and has recently filed for candidacy in the 2020 US presidential elections. With The War on Normal People, he not only draws attention to current socioeconomic issues but goes on to proposes concrete measures to face them. Yang uses the word “normal ” in the sense of “average” but reminds his readers that the “average” falls lower than they might think. As Yang points out, “the normal American did not graduate from college and doesn’t have an associate ’s degree. He or she perhaps attended college for one year or graduated high school [and] has a net worth of . . . about $6K excluding home and vehicle equity.” It is these “normal” Americans for whom the consequences of shifting from human to machine labor have been and will be most dire. Although “automation [has already] eliminated millions of manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2015,” Yang believes that the bulk of its impact is yet to come: “I love capitalism[, but] capitalism with the assistance of technology is about to turn on normal people.” However, to think that high-qualification white-collar jobs are immune to this change would be mistaken. The key criterion for the automation of a profession is the extent to which that profession is repetitive or routine, not the extent to which it is manual. Considering that the Federal Reserve classifies almost half of current US jobs as “routine,” Yang contends that the potential impact of continued automation is serious indeed. Yang sees as misguided in the current context the claim that technological revolutions always compensated loss of certain professions by the creation of new fields of employment. A number of specific manual professions becoming obsolete does not compare in quality or impact to any (including any new) routine work being lost to human employment. “History repeats itself until it doesn’t,” he cautions. As a solution to the socioeconomic vulnerability that would result from increasing automation, Yang proposes to pay a universal basic income, whereby each working-age adult is to receive a “Freedom Dividend” of $1,000 a month, which roughly hits the current national poverty line. To gauge the impact of his proposal, he lists a multitude of current and historical UBI experiments (from Alaska and Finland to UBI aid payments in Kenya), which seem to all offer similarly positive conclusions. For instance, in the Canadian town of Dauphin, thirteen thousand people received a four-year UBI, lifting everyone above the poverty line, with researchers finding “minimal effect on work.

Obtaining a sufficient citizenship-based income without work obligations is fundamentally opposing the foundations of the welfare systems that are in place nowadays. As BI has gained increasing attention in public debates and among policymakers, questions arise about its social legitimacy. This study is the first to analyse a broad range of explanatory individual and contextual factors that may affect popular support for BI. In addition, we study how BI support is related to support of current welfare provisions, to analyse how radically different people perceive a BI to be. We use a unique survey question – available for 23 European countries, from the recent release of the European Social Survey (2016) –that introduces BI with an extended definition, emphasizing its universal and unconditional character and that it will replace other benefits and services and is paid for by taxes. Results show relatively high, but varying levels of support among European countries and social groups. People who are in a more vulnerable socio-economic position support BI more, as well as political left-wingers, egalitarianists and people who support targeting benefits at the poor. Also, a BI is more supported in countries with higher levels of material deprivation. This pattern of relations on both the individual and contextual levels seems to suggest that it is not the universal character or its unconditionality that makes a BI so attractive to a large share of the European population, but the fact that it provides (poor) people with a guaranteed minimum income. We also find that people who support other welfare reforms are more supportive of a BI. This, and the fact that younger people are more pro-BI might give hope to BI advocates who present the proposal as a social system of the future.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0958928719882827,Public opinion on basic income: Mapping European support for a radical alternative for welfare provision

Helicopter money appears in this light as a new paradigm of extensive growth, which at fi rst glance comes off as a fi nancial innovation, but paradoxically rather bears a relationship with a pre-capitalist conception of value. Moreover, helicopter money is a wage-substitute transfer that does not respond to the social and symbolic void that has replaced work. It appears to be a welfare instrument, while it can only rest on the separation of production and consumption on a global scale.

It might, in some conditions, reduce some of the worst aspects of our current workplace relationships. But, by the same token, it might exacerbate them, especially if a basic income becomes a substitute for collective self-organization by workers.

We extend previous research on citizens’ preferences showing a link between job automation and demand for redistribution to the case of UBI preferences. Using European Social Survey data in 21 countries, we find no association between risk of job automation and UBI support. Our findings suggest that UBI and redistribution preferences differ in two important ways: First, opinion formation about UBI is still ongoing. Second, demand for UBI is lower than demand for redistribution, and traditional supporters of redistribution are sceptical about an UBI. This points to the multidimensionality of policy preferences.

-4.8721247,9.434577,2,"In a recent article in this Review, Richard Zeckhauser examines the subject of income transfer and concludes that a wage subsidy scheme (WS) is superior to a negative income tax plan (NIT). Zeckhauser's results are derived from a model in which a single representative poor man faces a single, fixed wage rate. The purpose of this comment is to extend Zeckhauser's discussion by comparing the two plans in a setting of many potential recipients, some unemployable and the rest facing different wages rates. When this is done, the superiority of the WS approach over the NIT does not appear quite as clear-cut as suggested in Zeckhauser's article. The many-recipient setting requires two modifications in Zeckhauser's WS plan. First, a positive income floor is needed to cover those who are unemployable or who can work only a small number of hours. Under the scheme presented in Zeckhauser's article, with a negative basic stipend, such individuals would actually be taxed to subsidize the more affluent poor. Second, the subsidy must vary with the wage rate in such a way as to provide a smooth transition from subsidized and unsubsidized rates. The NIT deals with both those problems by providing an income floor and a break-even earnings level at which the subsidy ceases. Zeckhauser is also well aware of the problems and, with Peter Schuck, has suggested a realistic operational WS plan in another writing.

I provide a summary of the randomized guaranteed income experiments from the 1970s, emphasizing how experimental methods using scattered sets of isolated participants cannot capture the crucial social factors that help to explain changes in people’s patterns of work. In contrast, I examine a community experiment from the same period, where all residents of the town of Dauphin, Manitoba, were eligible for basic income payments. This “macro-experiment” sheds light on the community-level realities of basic income. I describe evidence showing that wages offered by Dauphin businesses increased. Additionally, labor market participation fell. By ignoring the social interactions that characterize real-world community contexts, randomized studies underestimate the decline in labor market participation and its impact on employers. These findings depend to a great extent on the details of the policy design, and as such I conclude that the oft-proposed right–left ideological alliance on basic income is unlikely to survive the move from basic income as a broad policy umbrella to basic income as a concrete policy option.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1536504219830673,Basic Income and the Pitfalls of Randomization

Here we explore policy options for an Australian Basic Income. Our analysis responds to concerns that Basic Income is both too expensive and too radical a departure from existing welfare state structures to be a feasible policy option. Drawing on policy and Basic Income scholarship we identify changes to Australia’s current means-tested benefits structures that move substantially towards Basic Income while remaining consistent with historic policy norms, which we call ‘affluence testing’. Using microsimulation we explore fiscal and distributional trade-offs associated with the implementation of an affluence-tested Basic Income. Our results suggest Basic Income has the potential to significantly reduce inequality and poverty while also requiring taxes to rise substantially. Placing these trade-offs in international context we find the policy would reduce inequality to levels similar to Nordic welfare states while increasing overall taxation to approximately the OECD average.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1035304620964272,Between universalism and targeting: Exploring policy pathways for an Australian Basic Income

Embracing the French Regulation School approach, we maintain that such a compromise is founded on the redistribution of productivity gains. Describing the dynamics of productivity enables a better understanding of the main features and development of contemporary capitalism. In advancing our argument, we focus on the socioeconomic transformation that has overtaken the Fordist paradigm within Western countries and propose the term “cognitive capitalism” to describe the new economic system.

The BIG policy is dependent for its existence on the very system it wishes to undermine. Second, the macroeconomic effects of BIG on contemporary economies that use modern money are destabilizing.

Van Parijs’ work constitutes the most ambitious attempt within the literature to ground a justification of BI within a systematic normative framework. In this paper I argue that key elements of his framework should form part of any progressive justification of BI. Specifically, his linking of the principle of ‘real freedom for all’ with the policy mechanism of the ‘highest sustainable basic income.’ I take issue with Van Parijs’ treatment of compensation for unequal internal endowments based on the criterion of ‘undominated diversity’ and I reject the ‘external resources’ approach to justifying the funding of a substantial BI, including Van Parijs’ ‘jobs as assets’ argument. I introduce the concept of ‘total social productivity’ as a means of understanding the production and reproduction of society in a manner that anchors the justification of BI in a commitment to a ‘deep form of social reciprocity.’ Finally, I suggest that BI be framed as a ‘pragmatic-utopian reform.’",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0022,Real Freedom for All Revisited – Normative Justifications of Basic Income

What is of interest is his emphasis on the manner in which recognition principles change over time, through processes of social reproduction and conflicting values, and his treatment of the importance of reciprocity of recognition.

On occasions, it seemed as if a form of basic income was firmly upon the political agenda of the incumbent government. Many sections of society, such as the aged, are guaranteed their income will not fall below the poverty line. Many people with severe impairments are guaranteed an income. As will be discussed, one group of people with a specific disability is guaranteed a basic income whilst others with severe impediments are not. In recent times, the Productivity Commission has recommended introducing a comprehensive income guarantee for all people with severe disabilities. The issue plaguing the introduction of a universal basic income has been a desire by Australian governments to target benefits to specific categories of people. Such a practice creates problems of administrative simplicity at the edges of such categories and, as a consequence, some people miss out.

Using India as an illustration, the paper discusses the trade-offs that need to be recognized in adopting a UBI in these contexts. It shows that replacing the 2011 Public Distribution System (PDS) with a UBI results in losses for many low-income households, although much of this can be reduced by recycling the “out-of-system” PDS losses and the fiscal savings from excluding the highest-income groups as higher UBI transfers. In contrast, replacing inefficient energy subsidies—raising energy prices to efficient levels to internalize the negative environmental externalities of energy consumption—could simultaneously deliver unambiguous distributional gains, help address fiscal pressures, and improve energy efficiency with associated environmental and health gains.

A comparable analysis for 10 countries ranging from low-income Haiti, Mozambique, and Nepal; lower-middle-income India and Indonesia; upper-middle-income Brazil, Kazakhstan, and South Africa; to high-income Chile and the Russian Federation provides a better understanding of how the poverty and distributional implications of UBI reforms may vary depending on country level of income, the existing welfare state structure, and the taxation structure. In order to finance a UBI with meaningful impacts on poverty, replacing subsidies will not prove sufficient, and most countries will need to increase taxes, but in most cases, the burden of taxation on the top 10 percent would need to increase substantially—often by politically unrealistic proportions.

Though endowed with incredible natural resources spanning from significant reserves of gold, diamond, coltan, copper to vast African forests and impressive water resources, it is still considered as one of the poorest countries on the planet. For a long time, its economy has had nothing to show for all these resources as the Congolese people continue to live in extreme poverty. To survive, the Congolese people engage in a range of activities to generate income and most families rely on 'solidarity grants' from family members and relatives that either work or conduct a personal business. Most of these families remain unbanked. Due to the absence of reliable and private financial institutions, almost 90% of all financial transactions are cash-based. However, as the number of banks increases throughout the past few years, there is a possibility to encourage and perform cashless transactions. In this paper, we demonstrate an implementation of a Service-Oriented Architecture approach in the design of a eWallet system. A typical scenario has been presented to highlight the major components of the system to be implemented as contextualized in the ecosystem. A series of models, from the business processes to the technical architecture and service model for the system, has been developed to represent every step of the solution.

In line with a dialectical and conflicting concept of basic income, it proposes a mechanism for the reappropriation of the decision-making process, which opens up spaces for deconstruction and conflict. However, the concept must be calibrated for the conditions in which the right to a basic income is claimed; it must also take account of prevailing power relations.

Firstly, the income distribution and the Gini coefficient of different income groups in cities and towns are measured. On this basis, the changes of income distribution and the Gini coefficient of different income groups after they receive social relief income from the government are calculated. So, we can get the comprehensive effect of the government's individual income tax - social relief policy mode. The analysis results show that the individual income tax - social relief policy model has played a positive role in narrowing the income gap, but the effect is relatively small. The research believes that the adjustment and improvement of individual income tax policy and the government's targeted increase of social relief expenditure are helpful to the goal of adjusting the income distribution gap.",,Calculation of Effects of the Individual income Tax – Social Assistance Policy Mode Towards Different Income Classes

-14.450101,14.83223,2,"Are there ways that contemporary capitalism can be rendered a dramatically more egalitarian economic system without destroying its productivity and capacity for growth? This book explores two proposals, unconditional basic income and stakeholder grants, that attempt just that. In a system of basic income, as elaborated by Philippe van Parijs, all citizens are given a monthly stipend sufficient to provide them with a no-frills but adequate standard of living. This monthly income is universal rather than means-tested, and it is unconditional--receiving the basic income does not depend upon performing any labor services or satisfying other conditions. It affirms the idea that as a matter of basic rights, no one should live in poverty in an affluent society. In a system of stakeholder grants, as discussed by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, all citizens upon reaching the age of early adulthood receive a substantial one-time lump-sum grant sufficiently large so that all young adults would be significant wealth holders. Ackerman and Alstott propose that this grant be in the vicinity of $80,000 and be financed by an annual wealth tax of roughly 2 percent. A system of stakeholder grants, they argue, expresses a fundamental responsibility: every American has an obligation to contribute to a fair starting point for all. This is volume 5 of the Real Utopias Project, which embraces a tension between dreams and practice. It is founded on the belief that what is pragmatically possibly is not fixed independently of our imaginations, but is itself shaped by our vision. The fulfilment of such a belief involves   utopias: utopian ideals that are grounded in the real potentials for redesigning social institutions. In its attempt at sustaining the deepening serious discussion of radical alternatives to existing social practices, the Real Utopias Project examines various basic institutions and focuses on specific proposals for their fundamental redesign",,Redesigning Distribution: basic income and stakeholder grants as alternative cornerstones for a more egalitarian capitalism

Buchanan set out a proposal for a ‘demogrant’—a form of universal basic income that applied the principles of generality and non discrimination to the tax and the transfer sides of the scheme and was to be implemented as a constitutional rule outside the realm of day-to-day politics. The demogrant has received surprisingly little scholarly attention, but this article locates it in Buchanan’s broader constitutional political economy project and shows it was a logical application of his theoretical framework to the problem of inefficient and unfair welfare systems when reform to the basic institutions of majoritarian democracy was not forthcoming. The demogrant aims to end the problems of majority cycling and rent seeking that plague contemporary welfare states and therefore offers a model of welfare without rent seeking—a constitutional welfare state. We compare Buchanan’s demogrant model to other universal basic income and negative income tax models and consider the most important criticisms. We conclude that rescuing the demogrant model from relative obscurity would be a fruitful future task of applied constitutional political economy and public choice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10602-020-09321-7,Welfare without rent seeking?

It has been defined as an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement, and would likely have significant implications for all socially valuable activities including those without direct economic benefit; caring is one such activity. Basic Income might replace other benefits, some of which are multi-dimensional in the way that they support citizens, going beyond the financial support that a Basic Income offers. One example is parenting leave, which can have multiple aims, including gender equality in care as well as in the labour market. Whilst advocates argue that Basic Income would alleviate child and maternal poverty, critics are concerned that it would further entrench rather than undermine a gendered division of paid and unpaid labour.

The model is performed using a Côte d’Ivoire’s 2003 social accounting matrix (SAM) based on the 1998 household survey composed of 4,200 households, and 2003 national accounts data. The paper uses a value added tax (VAT) financing approach to provide a reasonable feasible scenario, as we are all consumers. The results suggest that the macroeconomic impacts of the basic income grant are a powerful social protection tool in fighting poverty and inequality towards a welfare state.",https://doi.org/10.15304/rge.25.1.6481,Quantitative impacts of basic income grant on income distribution in Cote d’Ivoire: Time to change our societies

Starting from the premise that a state is a collective enterprise that generates a surplus, it contends that any human being who is an “obedient” member of that state has a right to some share of the surplus. That right—which arises from the relationship between the individual and the state, and is independent of need—could justify the entitlement to a basic income. Such income should be provided in cash, not in kind, because the latter risks depriving the individual of the enjoyment of his share of the surplus—in effect, forcing him to forfeit or transfer it to others if he does not use the public goods or services provided by the state.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190882228.003.0025,Basic Income as a Human Right?

To say that basic needs justify both of these rights raises obvious doubts. And yet, even if we accept that the satisfaction of basic needs is justified in a particular welfare state, it cannot be regarded as justifiable in the version adopted by most welfare states today. Social rights are intellectually poorly justified and each serves as a rhetorical tool with which the development of a social state is justified. A growing social state impedes economic growth, particularly in poorer states, where it is the only mechanism which may end their poverty. The expansion of a social state pushes out more effective non-public mechanisms through which people in need receive assistance and help. It entails levying higher taxes, which in turn reduces the economic freedom of individuals and tends to have a negative impact on economic growth. Hence more social rights – less economic freedom – less welfare.",https://doi.org/10.14746/rpeis.2016.78.3.1,Więcej praw – mniej wolności – mniej dobrobytu

Social changes may be better understood in the background of work evolution. Today the concept of waged work has been extended to unpaid activities. At the same time, the working life has been changed from a stable model to a flexible one. The work, its standards and social distribution, are also different now. Erich Fromm’s concept of ‘social character’ clarifies the changes and explains the consequences of the social changes. The relations to work are also different. During these changes - unemployment included - concepts of the unconditional basic income were studied. These concepts explain why it’s possible for people without waged work to participate in community life and consumption, without being excluded. The author presents the basic social changes that affected many different subpopulation and age groups.",https://doi.org/10.1515/scr-2016-0012,"Links Between Work, Character, and Education.

Some critics reject that conclusion on the grounds that it violates requirements of reciprocity or prohibitions on exploitation, free-riding and parasitism. This paper explores a less familiar critique, which operates within the same resource egalitarian parameters as Van Parijs's argument, and leaves unchallenged his conviction that justice requires a basic income. Instead the paper suggests two reasons to doubt his ambitious claims about its magnitude. First, the paper argues that if envy elimination is the fundamental egalitarian aim then Van Parijs's argument for boosting basic income by including jobs within the class of external assets to be equalized is unsuccessful. Second, it argues that Van Parijs fails to show that the provision of basic income should not be constrained by a more restrictive principle for correcting inequalities in personal resources than his favored compensatory norm. Before defending these criticisms, two preliminary sections describe Van Parijs's distributive principles and his central argument for basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266267100003606,Resource Egalitarianism and the Limits to Basic Income

The prominent display of FVI therein is at odds with the limited significance of FVI for valuation. Specifically for unsophisticated users, who rely on financial reports to signal the importance and meaning of financial items, a concern exists that FVI might be overemphasised. This paper investigates this issue and formulates and tests two suggestions, intended to keep unsophisticated users from overemphasising FVI: 1) education about the irrelevance of FVI for valuation; and 2) a two-column matrix that does not display a separate column for total comprehensive income. Participants were provided with the financial reports of two fictitious manufacturing companies, and performed valuation-relevant tasks: income prediction, risk assessment, and management evaluation. The financial reports were devised in such a way that they allowed to infer the significance participants attached to FVI. For income prediction and risk assessments, participants did not attach significance to FVI.

As a superior justification of basic income, I propose William James’ social ethics: it uses listening, experimentation, and revision as foundations for ethics; it acknowledges the personal, social, and cultural forces in selfhood; and it recognizes that all activity is valuable in the creation and maintenance of cultural norms and habits. I argue that the best justification for basic income is “pragmatic inclusion for an ethical democracy,” in which basic income is an example of pragmatic inclusion that creates the conditions for an ethical democracy, wherein everyone has access to the decision-making processes that form a culture.",,Pragmatic inclusion for a democratic society: William James' social ethics and the justification of basic income

40.60219,-23.996063,4,"One of the core dilemmas of current welfare politics is the question of how to ensure social protection while providing incentives to seek employment at the same time. A way to address this dilemma is to base policies and policy models on the principle notion that ‘work must pay’; in other words, income from employment should be higher than the social support of the unemployed. However, how accurately do these approaches and models represent the reality of benefit recipients, particularly in the context of increased employment precariousness? In this article, we use the cases of two disadvantaged regions in Czech Republic in order to contrast the presumptions of ‘making work pay’ policies with the everyday experience of welfare recipients. As we show, their situations are strongly shaped by current changes in the labour market, particularly the precarious character of accessible employment and high levels of indebtedness. The modelling of financial employment incentives and the public policies based on these calculations often do not correspond with the reality of welfare recipients that are often cycling in and out of precarious forms of employment. However, the authors’ main claim is that the very idea of the ‘work must pay’ approach focuses on the wrong question. A truly functioning financial incentive would need to focus not solely on the difference in income between those who work and those who do not work, but rather should analyse what type of arrangements allow working households to rise permanently above the poverty line.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0958928718805870,Work must pay: Does it?

Point of departure is an economy with job scarcity. A fair way to deal with job scarcity is to grant everybody an equal right to work, where these rights can be freely traded. It turns out that such a Labour Rights scheme and a basic income scheme are equivalent. The equivalence is that the price of Labour Rights and the unemployment benefit corresponds to the income tax rate and basic income respectively. The tax rate can thus be considered as what workers have to pay to appropriate scarce job assets. Both schemes allow that some people voluntarily abstain from doing paid work, in return for a financial compensation. Therefore, the advantages in terms of equity and efficiency of a Labour Rights scheme equally apply to the basic income proposal. This analysis provides an argument against cutting unemployment and social assistance benefits during economic downturns and it offers new insights to evaluate the parasitism and exploitation objection raised against basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0770451800011489,"Basic income, unemployment and job scarcity"

I evaluate the ‘pin money’ hypothesis of the feminist scholarship, which is closely linked to what economists often refer to as an ‘added worker effect’. An improved economy may generate incentives for some married women in various occupations to make significant alterations to their labour market connections. Panel data are used to examine the effects of changes to women's hours, for example, whether some respondents opt out or reduce their hours given the rising incomes of economic partners. The methodology involves the use of two panels of the Statistics Canada, Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics and a random effects probit model to estimate various participation equations of labour decisions over time within a household context.

In this article we argue that this strategy has the potential to generate significant violations of neutrality. The problem arises from the fact that individuals with certain rates of time preference often want to use social institutions as self-binding mechanisms and as a result may exhibit a preference for in-kind benefits or other institutional arrangements that are frequently misclassified as paternalistic.

It is shown that most of these criteria will be compatible with, or actually select, the zero basic income policy and reject the basic income maximizing one.

As per analysis 98% of the world people concentrate only 2 % of the Global wealth, it is to eliminate poverty and bridge the gulf between the haves and have not’s. A Universal Basic Income is, like many rights, unconditional and universal: it entails that every citizen should have a right to a basic income to meet their needs by virtue of being citizens.     Methods : The study is centered on the concept of descriptive type. The concept of Universal Basic Income is not new. Of late, it is gaining currency among the Governments throughout the world in the light of growing disparities between the rich and the poor and it’s an endeavor on the part of the Governments to provide the poor safety nets. It is paid at regular intervals to the needy, may be monthly, to take out a decent living. Finland and Scotland pioneered UBI. But, Finland abandoned the programme because of lack of funds.     Findings : Universal Basic Income gained prominence in India with “Garibo Hatao” slogan given by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Like in other countries, itis aimed at providing every Indian living Below Poverty Line (BPL) with a minimum income. A fixed amount would be transferred to the account of the beneficiary in the country. There are some conceptual arguments against providing Universal Basic Income. Primary being, it induces laziness and reduces the incentive to work among the people. Should income be detached from employment? Itis a concern out of reciprocity. The Economic survey 2016-17 had estimated UBI’s cost at 4.9% of GDP. This is against 5.2 % GDP spent on all 950 central sector and centrally sub-sponsored schemes.     Application:   All the political parties support this type of schemes to reduce the income inequalities between the rich and the poor. Infact, it is a mesmerizing scheme to lure common people to garner votes.

Left-leaning individuals facing high labour market risk and/or on low incomes are more supportive of a BIG, whereas current union members are less likely to support a BIG, consistent with the insider-outsider literature. However, when controlling for confounding variables, union membership is not statistically significant, suggesting that it is not membership per se, but the characteristics of unionised workers that make them less supportive. In many countries, a coalition between centrist and left-leaning individuals therefore seems most promising, but its political feasibility depends on whether enough union members are favourable to a BIG and on the level of opposition from high income and/or conservative parts of the electorate.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2018-0021,The Politics of the Basic Income Guarantee: Analysing Individual Support in Europe

Its specification is something necessary when it comes to give a conscious political direction to all mechanisms and institutional devices that make up social policyas a whole. The way contemporary political philosophy has approached the proposal of a Basic Income constitutes an especially revealing example of this question. In this paper I present, first, the conceptual framework and the analysis of social life from which republican tradition has tackled its controversial notions of freedom and neutrality. Second, I compare the perspective of republican freedom with the notion of freedom that operates within the framework of Philippe Van Parijs real freedom perspective, which upholds a criterion of justice stating that a free society is that in which the number of options at the most disadvantaged person disposal is the greatest. Third, I defend an approach to Basic Income requiring a categorization of options so as to give priority to those options that, even being -maybe- of less importance in numerical terms, confer individuals greater guarantee of security in the definition and development of their own life plans, that is, that ensure the absence of arbitrary interference by others. In that way, I propose, in keeping with the republican tradition, a normative approach to Basic Income in which it is assumed that those entities that are to be considered free -or unfree- are not decisions themselves, hut socio-institutionally embodied individuals facing the task of making them. I finally show the outcome of the bringing into play of the republican perspective when it comes to politically -institutionally- design the implementation of Basic Income in the context of the market societies we are living in.",https://doi.org/10.3989/isegoria.2005.i33.428,Sociologías de la elección y nociones de libertad: la Renta Básica como proyecto republicano para sociedades de mercado

The present proposal, radical as it may seem to some, is accordingly offered as worthy of consideration. The main section of this article is on a proposed scheme, named Asset and Income Limits, for instituting maxima to the legitimate incomes and assets of individuals. This scheme involves every individual being associated with two bank accounts, an asset account (their own property) and a holding account (held in escrow). Other parts of the advocated change in economic landscape are a radically different understanding of the concept of work and the introduction of a basic income. The roles of technology and culture, in creating both the opportunities and the obstacles to a transformation of society, are discussed. Non-monetary, non-convertible rewards for exceptional contributions to society are described. The scheme enhances freedom, being neutral in relation to many other value systems, such as the secular/sacred spectrum. The qualitative versus quantitative dichotomy is addressed, and it is concluded that the most that can be said of a just and sustainable society that has yet to be created is that the maximum income should be no more than one order of magnitude greater than the basic income, that is ~10 times at the most.

We share with Balopoulos the view that in econometric models of fiscal policy the public parameters should appear explicityly. By letting them do so in our model we can by simulation distinguish and compare the effects on e.g. revenues and income distribution after taxes of different specified changes in the parameter set. The level and distribution of income before taxes also appear explicitly, so the built-in flexibility of the tax system can be investigated. The model is partial; so far e.g. multiplier effects can not be dealt with. The plan of the paper is to present our tax model and to some length go into some of its applications. In section 1 we give an outline of the model and present some tests of the predictive power of the model.

12.655841,-29.971054,0,"By the beginning of the 20th century, Australia was commonly acknowledged to be amongst the world leaders in the supply of social provisions to its citizens. However. Australia gradually lost ground in this arena compared with other developed countries. The election of the Whitlam Labor Government in 1972 presented Australia with the first reform oriented government since the end of the Second World War: a considerable number of suggestions were put forward to extend and improve social welfare programs. 

This study investigates those suggestions which dealt with the development of more comprehensive income maintenance programs. It looks, in particular, at the proposal made by the Poverty Inquiry to introduce a Guaranteed Minimum Income - and examines why it (or a similar scheme) was not implemented and what, if any, ideological obstacles to its introduction remain relevant in the last part of this century. But before that can be done, it is necessary to examine the existing system of income maintenance, its structure, the mechanisms which create that structure, and to ascertain what makes the present system of income maintenance attractive to many people.

Attitudes to work, the family and the way social need is viewed affect the public's preparedness to support welfare initiatives; these attitudes are considered preliminary to an examination of a number of generalised income guarantee proposals. The history of income guarantee schemes suggested in Britain, the United States of America and Australia is provided as a backdrop against which the ideological debates which such proposals evoked are assessed. 

The analysis of the ideological obstacles to income guarantees in Australia reveals the impediments embedded in the existing system of income maintenance and shows that these are not contained within the central tenets of Marxism, liberalism or social democracy. They are to be found associated with conservatism and discrimination based on gender, age, race, and locality. 

Before proceeding to estimate the likely response of either the Labor or Liberal Parties to income guarantees, the study establishes that there is no inherent incompatibility between the Australian mode of production and such guarantees. An examination of the Labor and Liberal Parties' social welfare platforms, their philosophical traditions, and spokespersons· pronouncements suggests that it would be possible for either Party to implement a form of income guarantee.",,Income maintenance in Australia: The income guarantee alternative

13.235718,-10.470947,4,"The idea of universal basic income (UBI)---a set income that is given to all without any conditions---is making an important comeback but there is no real evidence regarding its long-term consequences. This paper provides a very inexpensive evaluation of such a policy by studying its dynamic consequences in a general equilibrium model with imperfect capital markets and labor market shocks, in which households make decisions about education, savings, labor supply, and with intergenerational linkages via skill formation. The steady state of the model is estimated to match US household data. We find that a UBI policy that gives all households a yearly income equivalent to the poverty line level has very different welfare implications for those alive when the policy is introduced relative to future generations. While a majority of adults (primarily older non-college workers) would vote in favor of introducing UBI, all future generations (operating behind the veil of ignorance) would prefer to live in an economy without UBI. The expense of the latter leads to lower skill formation and education, requiring even higher tax rates over time. Modeling automation as an increased probability of being hit by an ``out-of-work'' shock, the model is also used to provide insights on how the benefits of UBI change as the environment becomes riskier. The results suggest that UBI may be a useful transitional policy to help current individuals whose skills are more likely to become obsolete and are unprepared for the increased risk, while, simultaneously, education policies may be implemented to increase the likelihood that future cohorts remain productive and employed.",https://doi.org/10.3386/w27351,Universal Basic Income: A Dynamic Assessment

However, by the end of the twentieth century, as a result of the changing family reforms and labour market patterns, leave arrangements had become a major policy issue with debates concentrating on entitlement, length of leave, and income support. This chapter discusses the development of leave policies, specifically parental leave in the Netherlands. This development has involved different interpretations of the purpose of leave and the divisions of responsibilities between the government, parents, and social partners. Starting from the view point in which parental leave was seen as a way to facilitate part-time employment, the Parental Leave Act provided a basic entitlement to take part-time, unpaid leave for a short period of time. It was left to the social partners to supplement this minimum. However, over time, public responsibility for leave has increased. This was evident not only in the increasing number of leave policies, but in the growing public involvement in the provision of income support as well. During this process, the interpretation of parental leave appeared to have changed from a labour market instrument into a more complex instrument intended to facilitate parenthood and the well-being of children.",https://doi.org/10.1332/policypress/9781847420671.003.0011,The Netherlands: bridging labour and care

26.65174,5.2090592,4,"Over the past forty years, income growth for the middle and lower classes has stagnated, while the economy (and with it, economic inequality) has grown significantly. Early automation, the decline of labor unions, changes in corporate taxation, the financialization and globalization of the economy, deindustrialization in the U.S. and many OECD countries, and trade have contributed to these trends. However, the transformative roles of more recent automation and digital technologies/artificial intelligence (AI) are now considered by many as additional and potentially more potent forces undermining the ability of workers to maintain their foothold in the economy. These drivers of change are intensifying the extent to which advancing technology imbedded in increasingly productive real capital is driving productivity. To compound the problem, many solutions presented by industrialized nations to environmental problems rely on hyper-efficient technologies, which if fully implemented, could further advance the displacement of well-paid job opportunities for many. While there are numerous ways to address economic inequality, there is growing interest in using some form of universal basic income (UBI) to enhance income and provide economic stability. However, these approaches rarely consider the potential environmental impact from the likely increase in aggregate demand for goods and services or consider ways to focus this demand on more sustainable forms of consumption. Based on the premise that the problems of income distribution and environmental sustainability must be addressed in an integrated and holistic way, this paper considers how a range of approaches to financing a UBI system, and a complementary market solution based on an ownership-broadening approach to inclusive capitalism, might advance or undermine strategies to improve environmental sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su11164481,Universal Basic Income and Inclusive Capitalism: Consequences for Sustainability

While there are some similarities, the SFP is functionally quite different from a BI. They are both income transfers independent of production. However, the SFP is not a flat rate payment, but is based on historical production. Like a BI, its unconditionality facilitates a change to a more market-rational production system, but these effects are relatively low. Equity objectives are also quite dissimilar relative to a pure BI instrument. There is some environmental-related conditionality, so it is more akin to Atkinson’s participation income.

Should the EU be involved in the governance of minimum income protection, and if it should, in which role precisely? This question raises a complex policy conundrum. We focus on a proposal by the European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) for an EU Framework Directive on Minimum Income Protection, in order to examine three aspects of that policy conundrum: (1) the instrumental relevance of minimum income protection; (2) the unequal burden of the redistributive effort that would be required across the EU if the Union were to impose hic et nunc a minimum income guarantee of 60% or 40% of the median national income in all Member States; and (3) the impact on dependency traps, under the same hypothesis. We illustrate each of these observations empirically, using cross-nationally comparable data on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) and minimum income protection levels (CSB-MIPI). Since a harmonised minimum income scheme requires a significantly greater budgetary effort on behalf of some of the poorer Member States in Eastern and Southern Europe, it raises a complex question about the meaning of solidarity within the EU. Enhanced solidarity within Member States cannot be decoupled from enhanced solidarity among Member States - and vice versa.

It is argued that, moral justifications notwithstanding, an open-ended commitment to either policy requires a clear grasp of its macroeconomic effects and institutional aspects. The tax-driven approach to money (also known as 'modern money') reveals that, while government funding for either proposal is not 'operationally' constrained, it produces disparate economic outcomes, depending on the program design of the universal guarantee. A modern money critique of the basic income proposal demonstrates that, in a monetary production economy, the unconditional supply of the monetary unit is inherently inflationary. By contrast, job guarantees can provide an important safety net by simultaneously stabilising prices. Additionally, job guarantees offer an institutional vehicle for achieving other social goals that are important to all advocates of universal assurances.

Philippe Van Parijs has also proposed a policy reform, called the basic income, that he's justified by reference to its ability to increase real freedom. Ackerman and Alstott, although very sympathetic to the basic income, nevertheless prefer stakes to a basic income because they believe stakes, if enacted, would promote real freedom to a greater extent than would a basic income. This paper raises questions about this point of view.

9.536107,-23.784298,0,"Current debates concerning the future of social security provision in advanced capitalist states have raised a citizens‟ basic income (CBI) as a possible reform package. The proposal is based on the principles of individuality, universality and unconditionality and ensures a minimum income guarantee for all members of society. Implementing a CBI, thus, entails radical reform of existing patterns of welfare delivery and would bring into question the institutionalized relationship between work and welfare, upon which modern welfare states are premised. It follows that the practice of arguing for a CBI has tended to concentrate on issues regarding the role of the state in providing income security for all citizens and, in particular, to issues pertaining to the world of paid work. However such a concentration indicates bias in the approach to study and serves to confine the welfare reform agenda. The purpose of this thesis is to make a positive contribution to the CBI literature by examining the proposal from a feminist economics perspective. It is argued that a CBI has the potential to promote equal rights of freedom for men and women and provides the basis for the development and sustainability of new and liberating patterns of working and living. However, this particular aspect of the proposal will never be fully considered as long as the analytical framework employed is dominated by an adherence to neo-classical economic theory. Embracing a feminist economics perspective allows for the identification of the androcentric bias inherent within the neo-classical construct and further provides an alternative methodological approach that serves to open up the debate to incorporate a more realistic vision of the nature of modern socio-economic relationships.",,Arguing for a citizens basic income: a contribution from a feminist economics perspective

We argue that the transitional demands of automation and a basic income may serve to stem postcapitalist transformation, stopping short at a post-work society characterized by the continuation of capitalist social relations and forms. Retaining money under the rule of the nation-state, the proposed transition between post-work and postcapitalist society breaks insufficiently with the present, in some ways making it worse by replacing a wage over which workers can lawfully bargain with a state-administered monetary payment that creates a direct relationship of power between citizen and state, liquidating labor struggles.

In this chapter, I question the characterization of the PFD as either a basic income or a robust model for one. I argue instead that the PFD is a resource dividend, a form of redistribution that is related to, but not synonymous with, a basic income. While the ideas of basic income and resource dividends share some philosophical justifications and some roots in intellectual history, they are different enough that they ought not to be confused. Beyond a philosophical desire for semantic clarity, the distinction matters because the justifications for different forms of redistribution, both those justifications that are part of the popular understanding and those that have a more limited academic currency, affect their chances for implementation, their sustainability, and their vulnerability to political processes. In particular, it is possible to design resource dividends in ways that are incompatible with the goals of a basic income and that lead to outcomes in tension with, if not opposed to, its goals. The prominence of the Alaska model in the contemporary basic income debate challenges basic income supporters to more clearly define the idea and specify criteria for the design of basic income schemes.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137015020_10,Basic Income and the Alaska Model: Limits of the Resource Dividend Model for the Implementation of an Unconditional Basic Income

There is a huge literature including empirical and theoretical studies on its efficiency and success on poverty alleviation. Despite this worldwide popularity, in a growing number of recent studies microfinance has been subjected to severe criticisms in that it has almost no success in solving inequality and redistribution problems deeply rooted in poverty. It has been accused of transforming the poor into the entrepreneur-client, being a poverty trap for the poor, reproducing the poverty cycle recursively and most crucially serving for neoliberalism. The first part of this study is allotted to these criticisms on microfinance policies. The main cause for poverty is lack of sustainable income. To generate this income for the poor to get out of poverty, there is one other alternative that has started to gain more interest in poverty reduction circle namely basic income. Basic income departs significantly from the microfinance model in that it is an income-generation suggestion based on the premise that the fight against poverty should be carried out within the context of social rights and inequality. This paper also aims to focus on the alternative paradigm of basic income poverty reduction by making a brief comparison between microfinance and basic income favoring the latter over the former.",,Two Different Poverty Reduction Approaches: Neoliberal Market Based Microfinance versus Social Rights Defender Basic Income

The result is that nation states that introduce a basic income to counter internal domination through labour automation, also have to look outside of their nation state.

This paper outlines a long-term reform for the consolidation of a health system that is akin to international standards and which may establish the structural conditions to reduce coverage inequity. This reform is based on a “structured pluralism” intended to avoid both a monopoly exercised within the public sector and fragmentation in the private sector, and to prevent falling into the extremes of authoritarian procedures or an absence of regulation. This involves the replacement of the present vertical integration and segregation of social groups by a horizontal organization with separation of duties. This also entails legal and fiscal reforms, the reinforcement of the MHS, the reorganization of health institutions, and the formulation of regulatory, technical and financial instruments to operationalize the proposed scheme with the objective of rendering the human right to health fully effective for the Mexican people.",https://doi.org/10.21149/8759,Universalidad de los servicios de salud en México

In connection of the exacerbation of the global problem of poverty and property inequality, the crisis of existing social welfare systems, the attention of scholars and practitioners is focused on finding new tools for social protection of the population. As a consequence, scientific research and practical experiments on the introduction of unconditional basic income in the world are being updated. The purpose of the article is to substantiate and determine the prerequisites for improvement of the social security system of the population based on the concept of basic income in Ukraine. Results. The relevance of the study of the preconditions, advantages, potential results and problems of introduction of unconditional basic income in Ukraine are substantiated. The authors consider the theoretical grounds for the expediency of its application in our country to compensate citizens for lost access to natural resources in an oligarchic-clan economy. An ability and sources of financing of unconditional basic income in Ukraine are analyzed. It is proposed to improve the taxation system (introduce a progressive income tax rate scale) and fiscal instruments (in particular in the area of natural resource rentals) for this purpose. The prerequisites for the introduction of basic income are defined: a high level of civic awareness and economic consciousness of the population, a stable and effective tax system, the deduction of income and property. Based on the analysis of the social structure of the population of Ukraine, its citizens’ self-assessment of their incomes, the assumption is made about the inefficiency of basic income as a stimulator of human capital development in the direction of entrepreneurship and creativity in the short term after its introduction. It is suggested that basic income in Ukrainian realities can have a positive effect on solving problems such as labor emigration, demographic situation, decline of the Ukrainian village, which requires appropriate social experiments. Conclusions. As a result, it is concluded that the use of unconditional basic income in Ukraine in combination with other social transfers is feasible under the conditions of: reforming the system of taxation and payments for the use of natural resources; legalization of shadow income; raising social standards to an objective level of satisfaction of human physiological and spiritual needs; strengthening the control over the efficiency of use of budgetary funds; stimulating investment in human capital; infrastructure improvements; raising the standard of living of the poorest population groups.

10.595621,-19.578957,4,"In the period from 1st October 2017 to 31st December 2019, the Dutch government allowed several municipalities to carry out so-called ‘basic income experiments’, ‘trust’ experiments, or ‘experiments low in regulation’. These experiments focused on giving exemptions on obligations attached to social benefits, allowing people to keep extra earnings on top of their social assistance benefits, and providing more guidance in finding work. In this paper, I critically evaluate the extent to which these experiments have had an effect on social policy in the Netherlands in both the short and long run. For municipalities, the main goal of these experiments was to examine whether an approach focused on trust and intrinsic motivation would lead to increased labour market participation and higher wellbeing. The national government approved the experiments; but in its evaluation, it focused solely on the outflow to work in line with the existing workfare approach. In the short run, the effects of the experiments appeared disappointing for those with the ambition of fundamentally reforming the social security system. However, in the struggle for framing and interpretation, advocates of a different social policy approach obtained success in the long run. Although the Participation Act was not initially amended, the recent coalition agreement of the new Government does propose a change related to the outcomes of the experiment; and in recent party manifestos, there are more far-reaching proposals to change social policy in the direction of a universal basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1177/13882627221109846,A Struggle for Framing and Interpretation: The Impact of the ‘Basic Income Experiments’ on Social Policy Reform in the Netherlands

This discussion paper tests this claim by examining the distributional impacts of three UBI schemes broadly designed to provide pathways to attainment of the Minimum Income Standard (MIS). We use microsimulation of data from the Family Resources Survey to outline the static distributional impacts and costs of the schemes. Our key finding is that even the fiscally neutral starter scheme would reduce child poverty to the lowest level achieved since 1961 and achieve more than the anti-poverty interventions of the New Labour Governments from 2000. The more generous schemes would make further inroads into the UK’s high levels of poverty and inequality, but at greater cost. We conclude by assessing fiscal strategies to reduce the up-front deficit of higher schemes, providing a more positive assessment of affordability and impact than critics have assumed.",https://doi.org/10.1332/175982721x16702368352393,Universal Basic Income is affordable and feasible: evidence from UK economic microsimulation modelling1

It is based on a systematic review of the literature from academic and non-governmental organization databases. The search of these databases yielded 24 articles, which were subsequently passed through open, axial, and selective coding. The resulting review found that women with disabilities in LMICs have severe difficulty participating and succeeding in education, employment and motherhood due to a number of interrelated factors: (i) hampered access to education, employment, intimacy and marriage, (ii) stigma and cultural practices resulting in discrimination and prejudice, and (iii) lack of support from family, teachers and institutions—all of which are exacerbated by poverty. Support from families, communities, the government, and non-governmental organizations improves women’s ability to fulfil their social roles (as students, employees and mothers), resulting in a better quality of life.

30.375895,-37.69516,0,"Since the late 1970s, massive and longlasting unemployment is the primary problem for social-economic policy in European welfare states, and to a lesser extent, also in the US. Especially long spells of unemployment and the so-called ‘modern poverty’ are not only corrosive for the persons concerned but also for society at large. Governments try to attenuate the consequences of unemployment and poverty by providing social benefits conditionally, and, in so far as in its power, to take employment-promoting measures. However, recent social-economic policy measures designed to reduce unemployment can largely be characterized as ‘piecemeal social engineering’. They vary from reducing the level of minimum wages, reducing the tax wedge, the introduction of work- and learnfare programmes for the unemployed, relaxation of firing and dismissal procedures, the implementation of work subsidies for low wage workers and more severe conditions for obtaining social benefits. All these measures are piece-meal because they keep the conditional nature of the arrangements of the welfare state intact. Almost all social benefits are in one way or an other connected with paid work: one is either too young or too old to do paid work (child allowances, state pensions), involuntary unemployed, disabled or sick (social assistance, unemployment and disability benefits) or preparing for work (scholarships). Job creation programmes and active labour market policies where the unemployed are assigned socially useful tasks to retain their benefit also strengthen the conditional nature of social benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-2726-0_3,Basic Income Confronted with some Popular Ideas of Justice

However, to assess the financial feasibility of basic income, it is also important to consider how much basic income will cost in the future. This is especially important in countries experiencing an ageing population, where the proportion of workers is expected to shrink. This article considers basic income as a universal life annuity and develops two models based on actuarial concepts to estimate the flat tax rate required to finance basic income. The first model considers the cost of basic income over the lifetime of the current population and the second model additionally considers changing population dynamics. The proposed models are conceptually simple, providing a straightforward way to assess the financial feasibility of basic income. Using Singapore data, the models show that the monthly cut-off income separating net contributors and net recipients is around $2710 and benefits around 39 % of adult residents. A tax rate of around 22 % is required to support a basic income of $600.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2019-0014,How Much Does Basic Income Cost? Modelling Basic Income as Universal Life Annuity

41.480427,-31.104338,4,"In the early 1980s, the welfare state, for too long regarded as a notable contribution to the establishment of a humane social order, had over the previous decade come under increasing attack. Some of its critics, especially in the UK and the USA, maintained that it had failed to deal satisfactorily with the problem of poverty. Others held that it was over-elaborate, created a psychology of dependence and imposed costs that needed to be reduced as part of a policy of general economic recovery. In a number of countries, cuts had already been imposed or were now contemplated. In this situation it was crucially important to direct attention once more to the basic objectives of the various welfare services from a systematic and comparative standpoint. Originally published in 1982, the authors of this book, one an economist and the other a specialist in social administration, subjected these aims to rigorous analysis and discuss the underlying issues of social philosophy. They then attempt to assess the various methods adopted for their attainment in Britain and comment on those adopted in the USA and in some continental European countries. Although the authors reject the more extreme assertion that the welfare state has been a failure, they point to the need to relate some of the policies followed more clearly to the basic objectives.

Obviously, there is some link between these two faults: because: since most people living in capitalist economies must work for wages as a major source of their incomes, inability to obtain a job means lower income. If jobs can be provided to the unemployed, inequality and poverty will be reduced - although such policy will not directly address the problem of excessive income at the top of the distribution. Most importantly, Keynes wanted to put unemployed labor to work - not digging holes, but in socially productive ways. This would help to ensure that the additional effective demand created by government spending would not be exhausted in higher prices as it ran up against bottlenecks or other supply constraints. Further, it would help maintain public support for the government's programs by providing useful output. And it would generate respect for, and feelings of self-worth in, the workers employed in these projects (no worker would want to spend her days digging holes that serve no useful purpose). President Roosevelt's New Deal jobs programs (such as the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps) are good examples of such targeted job-creating programs.

Second, most accounts are based on a flawed assumption that UBI leads to rampage inflation. Third, if macroeconomic considerations are not enough to justify implementing SELR over UBI, then insisting on the superiority of SELR can only stem from two types of moral reasons: on one hand from a perfectionist view of empowering the worst-off through labor and on the other from demands and obligations of reciprocity.

We analyzed the multiple-choice responses, using an ordered probit, and the written explanations of the respondents’ choices, using content analysis. The results suggest that while a higher UBI would increase consumption, it would likely be done responsibly. People with low incomes showed restraint in all categories. The qualitative analysis captures some of the complexities of people’s socioeconomic circumstances that support the notion of responsible consumption. The policy implication is that a UBI could be introduced at a low level and gradually increased to a level that maximizes societal benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2020-0006,Consumption Patterns under a Universal Basic Income

However, there is no comprehensive study on the cost and effect of BI in Turkey. This study aims to set a theoretical framework for BI, compare different views on the topic, evaluate implementations from the world, and analyze the feasibility of a BI program in Turkey by estimating its costs and distributional consequences using a tax–benefit microsimulation. The results show that, although it improves the income distribution, implementing a basic income scheme financed by income tax would impose a significant burden on the upper half of the income distribution due to widespread poverty and income inequality. In the baseline, individual-based scenario, every individual aged 15 or above is granted a BI equal to the poverty line, while children below age 15 are granted 30 percent of this amount. This plan costs 17.77 percent of the gross domestic product and it is covered by multiplying current income tax by 3.54. Implementation of this plan decreases the poverty rate from 12.43 percent to zero and the Gini index from 0.388 to 0.181.",https://doi.org/10.1017/npt.2021.27,Basic income and its applicability in Turkey

A new cash grant was designed along with a package of active policies. Four modalities of participation were then established depending on two criteria: whether attending these policies was mandatory or not, and whether participants’ additional income altered the amount of the grant or was instead net added on top. The context which initially moulded the pilot is firstly explained. Then, the cash schema and the active policies are described followed by an explanation of its experimental design. The main results at individual, community and institutional levels formerly released in the official reports are now integrated and jointly addressed. Finally, conclusions discuss some issues raised by the pilot’s results in light of the findings gathered in other similar basic income experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0047,Basic Income at Municipal Level: Insights from the Barcelona B-MINCOME Pilot

Active labour market policies are around to assist in enhancing labour market flexibility at the times of economic changes. Their key components are the so-called activation strategies that act as typical prerequisites of benefitting from unemployment security/support systems in every EU country. The workfare concept lies behind the public work programmes. There are serious professional debates whether public work can primarily be seen as a ’compulsion and work test’ or, rather, as an opportunity of entering the primary labour market. The available efficiency analyses unanimously state that public work forms have the biggest role in testing willingness to work and the obligatory nature is the strongest of all active labour market policies. Research also indicates that public work reintegrates only few people back to the primary labour market and the majority are restrained from seeking a job and other income generating activities. There are several reasons for and against public work and opinions differ.

This book explores two proposals, unconditional basic income and stakeholder grants, that attempt just that. In a system of basic income, as elaborated by Philippe van Parijs, all citizens are given a monthly stipend sufficient to provide them with a no-frills but adequate standard of living. This monthly income is universal rather than means-tested, and it is unconditional — receiving the basic income does not depend upon performing any labor services or satisfying other conditions. It affirms the idea that as a matter of basic rights, no one should live in poverty in an affluent society. In a system of stakeholder grants, as discussed by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, all citizens upon reaching the age of early adulthood receive a substantial one-time lump-sum grant sufficiently large so that all young adults would be significant wealth holders. Ackerman and Alstott propose that this grant be in the vicinity of $80,000 and be financed by an annual wealth tax of roughly 2 percent.

The author believes that the question of the future of labor should be reviewed in a social-philosophical perspective. The analytical potential of philosophical thinking can be useful in predicting the consequences of implementing the basic income initiative. The article proceeds from the premise that in the 21 st century the idea of basic income application turns from a utopian project into real measures roadmap. The economic well-being provided by the widespread use of technical means makes it possible to seriously plan the transfer of many workers employed in the sector of services and non-material production to basic income. The author points out that first of all it is necessary to assess the consequences of such a measure for the people. Traditionally, capitalist society has been built around a narrative that hard work is well rewarded. The opposition of labor and free time has shaped consumption patterns and life strategies for several generations. In the conclusion, the author suggests to consider whether, by removing such a system-forming element from the social structure, the society itself will be put under threat. It may turn out that an initiative aimed at changing society for the better will actually turn out to become a personal disaster for many people who will not be able to find a use for themselves in the new world, which is already not built around labor.

A recent narrative, endorsed by prominent tech-billionaires, says we face mass unemployment, and we need a basic income. In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is an entirely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment, and it can be done again. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Taking lessons from history, it is clear that unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy.

-34.6893,-7.256789,2,"Universal Basic Income (‘UBI’) is a regular cash payment made to all individuals by the State without any means or work testing. It has historically been debated upon and more than a few justifications for UBI have been made. UBI has entered policy debate in India ever since UBI was proposed by the Economic Survey 2016- 17 as a social welfare scheme suitable for India. In this paper, a normative justi- fication for UBI is sought to be arrived at. A right to basic income, by promoting ‘real freedom’ of individuals is said to be a part of the conception of substantive dignity of all individuals. It is important for the actualisation of other rights and freedoms of an individual.

22.070091,13.550322,4,"Introduction. The research is dedicated to the citizens of Ukraine. It is known that in many countries of the world there is a discussion about the possibility of introducing the ""Unconditional Basic Income of the Citizen"" (hereinafter - BBDG), and that is what encourages the governments of these countries to incline to such a decision. The draft law ""Basic Income of a Citizen of Ukraine"" (hereinafter - BSGU) is similar in form to BBDG and at the same time conceptually adapted to Ukrainian realities. Its adoption will be followed by the Constitution of Ukraine (Chapter II Rights, Freedoms and Duties of Man and Citizen).The subject of the research is the model of introduction of the basic income of a citizen of Ukraine - the law №1 for Ukraine. Goal. The article aims to describe the general, basic and final provisions of the draft law № 1 for Ukraine ""On the introduction of basic income of Ukrainian citizens"" which will contribute to the opening of new opportunities for Ukrainian citizens in health, education, self-realization through innovation and suffrage, will help to stop the outflow of labour and intellectual potential from Ukraine, providing each part of the total gross domestic product. The object of the study is the mechanism of introduction of the basic income of a citizen of Ukraine. Local self-government and the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine). Open-source materials were used for the study, namely summary information from the official website of the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture of Ukraine, DW website referring to the data the World Bank and 112ua, Constitution of Ukraine. In addition, the emergence of such a law will open new opportunities for citizens of Ukraine in health, education, self-realization through innovation and suffrage, where you can not only freely choose but also be elected to public authorities at various levels, will help to suspend the outflow of labour and intellectual potential from Ukraine, providing each part of the total gross national product. Methods. The following methods were used to conduct research and obtain its results - the method of analysis and synthesis, absolute and comparative advantages, socio-psychological and organizational-administrative methods, synergetic approach. Research results. Public organizations, journalists, and representatives of local self-government were involved in the discussion of the proposed bill. The result of the study is a peer-reviewed scientific development - the draft law ""On the introduction of basic income of citizens of Ukraine"", information on copyright and related rights is included in the bulletin № 61 and are considered published November 30, 2020, National Intellectual Property State Enterprise. Conclusions. Every year more and more people have temporary or part-time employment. Forms of labour relations are changing. Labour relations based on remote employment are spreading. The structure of labour collectives is modified and they begin to lose a clear organizational structure and disappear as a whole. Society is increasingly stratified by income. Every year artificial intelligence becomes a growing driver of technological progress in our progressive digital civilization. Already in the 1920s, global automation of labour processes will take place, which will lead to a significant reduction in the number of jobs. Scientists predict that by 2035, 70% of current jobs, including those related to routine manual labour, will be replaced by artificial intelligence. Under the above circumstances, states face problems of increasing the natural rate of unemployment due to a significant increase in the level of structural unemployment. That makes it necessary to provide more and more assistance for integration into society to people who have lost the prospect of employment due to the disappearance from the labour market of jobs and specialities that they own. The above information does not mean that people will suddenly have nowhere to work. Today, new professions are emerging every day, and in developed countries, more than 70% of the economy is in the service sector. However, the transition period, until people lose their main jobs and find new jobs, will be not only painful but very massive. This process will be accompanied by mass strikes, rallies, voting for populists and other destructive phenomena of socio-political development. Every year we witness the growing impoverishment of citizens, so the decision was made to initiate a bill on the Basic Income of Citizens of Ukraine as a mechanism to ensure the main human right - the right to a dignified life under the Constitution of Ukraine (Article 21. All people are free and equal in dignity and rights).",https://doi.org/10.32447/20784643.24.2021.17,MECHANISM FOR INTRODUCTION OF THE BASIC INCOME OF A CITIZEN OF UKRAINE

Wiles concluded his witty comparative assessment of Soviet and American employment trends by vouching for ‘the superiority of the Soviet system, even when there is full employment in the USA’.1 This conclusion, however, ignored the income and welfare implications of employment. A more comprehensive assessment of full employment and its economic effects cannot, on the other hand, avoid the question of whether increases in employment are the result of conscious policies or a by-product of inefficient planning. D. Granick has argued in favour of the first hypothesis, while P. Hanson, drawing on some aspects of Kornai’s work, has provided arguments for the second.2 The merit of Granick’s analysis is to link employment with the wage policy; Hanson, on the other hand, draws attention to the effects of low labour productivity on the demand for labour.

These gains were not insignificant for the individuals involved, and offer empirical insights into studies of basic income. While seeing the Australian government embrace more generous and basic income-like measures, we also note that during Covid-19 gendered and class inequalities increased.

Abstract

I argue in this article that implementation of the universal basic income would have positive effect on equality in three senses. First, it would enhance economic equality by increasing the level of employment, reinforcement of the workers’ bargaining power and redistributive forms of funding. Second, it would decrease inequalities between women and men by dismantling of the state of precarity, revaluation of care work and housework done by women and enhancement of their economic independence from their partners. And third, it would increase political equality and enable participatory democracy. Apart from understanding equality as a value in itself, I show that, according to Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, high inequalities of income lead to an array of social and health problems.

Critics of social assistance view dependency as an intrinsically negative state to be in, linked to “laziness” and oppression. They argue that basic income programs create dependency between the recipients of the programs and the provided service, and that this would reduce beneficiaries’ incentives to work. This paper contributes to the debate over the effectiveness of basic income programs by specifically analysing their impact on relationships of dependency. Throughout this analysis I will challenge the thesis that basic income fosters dependency by analysing two basic income pilots conducted in Madhya Pradesh, India. This paper finds that the fundamental assumptions underlying the concern that basic income fosters dependency in Madhya Pradesh are flawed. Relations of dependence are already present in the social fabric of rural India, and they are not intrinsically negative but instead represent ways through which people actively improve their position. Therefore, the question of basic income creating dependency is not the primary concern, and a more relevant policy question arises: how does the provision of basic income shape pre-existing relationships of dependency?

Should we stick to a generous welfare state with a sizeable basic income, but high marginal tax rates for the lower incomes and thus little incentives to work? Or, should we “make work pay” by subsidizing the work of low earners, but possibly at the cost of a smaller safety net? We think it is difficult to answer this question without making clear what individuals are (held) responsible for and what not. First, we present a new fair allocation, coined a Pareto Efficient and Shared resources Equivalent allocation (PESE), which compensates for different productive skills, but not for different tastes for working. We also characterize a fair social ordering, which rationalizes the PESE allocation. Second, we illustrate the optimal second-best allocation in a discrete Stiglitz (1982, 1987) economy. The question whether we should have regressive or progressive taxes for the low earners crucially depends on whether the low-skilled have a strictly positive or zero skill.

A basic income that is paid on a regular basis provides a way to prevent the emergence of cumulative misfortune, because the basic income at least partially replenishes the individual's ability to take the next calculated gamble. The upshot of this is a nonpaternalistic justification for an unconditional basic income that is paid regularly and is nonmortgageable. This has an important bearing on the debate between those who advocate a one-off endowment at the start of adult life and those who advocate a basic income paid regularly throughout one's life.

-10.869273,23.774412,0,"Abstract Recipients of public assistance and unemployment benefits face an effective marginal tax rate of (almost) 100%, since these payments decline in a ratio of one by one when own income is earned. The metaphor of an “unemployment trap” describes this labour supply disincentive quite accurately. A negative income tax could overcome this problem, but is considered to be too expensive and to entail some flaws from an allocative point of view. Starting from this critique, we propose a “Targeted Negative Income Tax”, which basically confines the negative income tax to the group of the long-term unemployed. This targeting ensures that the incentives are given to those who need them most, and avoids the massive fiscal burden associated with a general introduction of a negative income tax. The fiscal burden may even be reduced with each long-term unemployed person who is drawn back into the labour market. In this paper, we compare this proposal to some alternative measures created to provide work incentives such as the “Family Credit” and the “Earned Income Tax Credit” introduced in the UK and the US, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1515/zfwp-1997-0104,Wege aus der Arbeitslosenfalle – ein Vergleich alternativer Lösungskonzepte

We identify behavioral responses to these tax changes by comparing families who experienced a tax rate change to families who had a similar change in dependents but no resulting tax rate change. A primary advantage of our approach is that these changes can be anticipated, allowing us to estimate substitution effects that are not confounded by life-cycle income effects.

It discusses various approaches to taxation and presents a framework for a system that would affect both personal income and the social security system, replacing the one by a flat-rate income tax and the other by a guaranteed income. This idea has generated wide interest in a number of countries, and is being actively discussed by several political parties. This book explains how these changes would benefit a wide variety of social groups, leading to a greater redistribution of income. At the same time, it also raises the question of whether a single reform can meet the very different objectives of different supporters. The author reviews different areas of public economics in which there has been active research in recent years-- namely the theory of optimum taxation, public choice theory, general equilibrium analysis of incidence, numerical tax- benefit modelling, and econometric studies of work incentives--and asks how these contribute to our understanding of this particular policy reform. He also indicates the promising directions for future research.

At the same time, women continue to bear disproportionately larger shares of unpaid, poorly paid, part-time and other forms of irregular work. This study analyzes how Canadian fiscal policy reinforces the many social, economic and legal barriers women face when they try to gain equal access to full-time work with equal pay, and examines structural proposals that would remove or reduce these barriers to women’s labour force participation. The author concludes that four basic structural changes should be made at once to reduce those barriers as much as possible: recast all the joint provisions in tax and social assistance law as individual provisions, permit secondary earners to claim all the actual costs of work-related expenses, reduce the marginal tax rates imposed on low incomes and eliminate the bias against women caused by the rules governing employee fringe benefits, employment insurance and retirement pensions. Failing the political will to take all these steps, the author proposes the enactment of an earned income credit that can be claimed by all secondary earners to ameliorate the existing fiscal barriers to women’s labour force participation. Only such a credit system would counterbalance the unrelenting pressure on women to substitute unpaid work for paid work at the margins.",,Women and Employment: Removing Fiscal Barriers to Women's Labour Force Participation

The Covid‐19 pandemic is providing an additional impetus as governments instigate similar safety nets as employment falls in the wake of the virus. To date, much of the debate concerning UBI has taken place in disciplines outside the auspices of Human Resource Management with most commentary occurring within the spheres of economics and social policy. This conceptual study is one of the first within the human resource management (HRM) field to address the potential impacts of UBI on orientations to work and the management of employees. To do this, we focus on a central underpinning theory within HRM, the psychological contract and how this might be affected by its introduction.

So far, the basic income debate addresses gender only in so far as it would raise the income of the poorest, of whom a larger proportion are women. However, it is less clear how it might contribute to a transformation of gendered behaviour, making possible divergent shapes of life where binary and set notions of gender are not a restriction. We discuss the idea of basic income from a perspective of gender equality in the Swedish context.",https://doi.org/10.17645/si.v6i4.1487,Basic Income: The Potential for Gendered Empowerment?

15.435218,34.88418,4,"Economists' use of the term “equality” in reference to a distribution of incomes has historically been in the sense of a consensus for some statistical characteristic(s) of the distribution rather than a firm concept of equality. Of course such a concept rests on appropriate welfare assumptions about income and its distribution, assumptions which, for the most part, have been left implicit (and unknown) in discussions of income equality in the literature.



Our purpose in this paper is dual: first, we wish to discover an unambiguous, welfare-related equality measure. This we accomplish through suitable assumptions on a social welfare function. What is produced is an “index” of equality which describes the performance of a given distribution relative to the maximum welfare derivable from the total income it represents. The measure thus depends functionally on the welfare attributes of income, something which in reality we know little about.



This impasse leads us to inquire into the sensitivity of the index over specifications of the welfare function, which is done by comparing equality ranks for the states of the United States for 1960 under various functional forms and among curves within a given form. As an interesting secondary issue, the performance of traditional equality measures is tested relative to the welfare-oriented index to discover implications about their welfare content.



It is found that the equality index is, in certain ranges for the welfare function, insensitive to its specification. The findings lead directly to conclusions concerning traditional equality measures, their usefulness in correctly accounting for equality differences among alternative income distributions and, concomitantly, their implicit welfare inputs.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4991.1967.tb00732.x,A SOCIAL WELFARE VIEW OF THE MEASUREMENT OF INCOME EQUALITY

This paper examines the potential tradeoffs between targeting these transfers towards low income households versus providing universal cash transfers, also known as a Universal Basic Income. We start by discussing how the fact that most households in poor countries do not pay income taxes changes how we conceptually think about Universal Basic Incomes. We then analyze data from two countries, Indonesia and Peru, to document the tradeoffs involved. The results suggest that, despite the imperfections in targeting using proxy-means tests, targeted transfers may result in substantially higher welfare gains than universal programs, because for a given total budget they deliver much higher transfers to the poor. On the other hand, targeted transfers do lead to more horizontal equity violations, and do create an implied tax on consumption in the region where benefits are phased out. We discuss how alternative targeting approaches, such as community-targeting and self-targeting, can be used to further improve targeting in some situations.",https://doi.org/10.3386/w24939,Universal Basic Incomes vs. Targeted Transfers: Anti-Poverty Programs in Developing Countries

While it does include a number of progressive policy reforms, the overall direction is at best inadequate and at worst unjust.

Firstly, we offer a characterisation of predistribution. Secondly, we will explore the extent to which the disbursement of an unconditional basic income is aligned with the objectives of predistribution. This piece will then seek to dispel concerns with unconditional basic income that are based on an alleged disincentive to work and on the inflationary risks of the policy.

In this paper, we use an interpretative approach to examine the design and ultimate rejection of the Kansas tax policy experiment that ran from May 2012 to June 2017. The central design element of this experiment was the fundamental disruption of the long-standing principle of horizontal equity (fairness), in which non-wage business income was relieved of income tax, while wage income was taxed. By interpreting this experiment through a Bourdieusian lens, we identify five key themes that are helpful in understanding income tax design, tax fairness, and the role played by political elites. Overall, we contribute to the literature by highlighting the way in which cultural capital may be used by political elites to reformulate groups of taxpayers in order to justify unequal treatment of equal taxpayers, which represents a violation of the notion of horizontal equity (fairness). We also highlight that although such violations of fairness in income tax system design may be sustainable in the short run, over the longer term, notions of fairness are so deeply embedded in the habitus of individual taxpayers that a return to the status quo is likely.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bar.2022.101172,The role of political elites in income tax system design and tax fairness

Obviously, there is some link between these two faults: since most people living in capitalist economies must work for wages as a major source of their incomes, the inability to obtain a job means a lower income. If jobs can be provided to the unemployed, inequality and poverty will be reduced--although such policy will not directly address the problem of excessive income at the top of the distribution. Most importantly, Keynes wanted to put unemployed labor to work--not digging holes, but in socially productive ways. This would help to ensure that the additional effective demand created by government spending would not be exhausted in higher prices as it ran up against bottlenecks or other supply constraints. Further, it would help maintain public support for the government's programs by providing useful output. And it would generate respect for, and feelings of self-worth in, the workers employed in these projects (no worker would want to spend her days digging holes that serve no useful purpose). President Roosevelt's New Deal jobs programs (such as the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps) are good examples of such targeted job-creating programs.

Evidence on India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act does not suggest that the potential for either providing work when needed or reducing current poverty is being realized, despite pro-poor targeting. Instead, work is often rationed by local leaders in poor areas, and the poverty impact is small when all the costs are considered. Decentralized implementation of the right-to-work poses serious challenges in poor places. The option of income support using cash transfers also has both pros and cons. Widely-used methods for finely targeting cash transfers tend to miss many poor people, and discourage those reached from earning extra income. Yet it cannot be presumed that switching to a universal basic income will reduce poverty more than workfare or finely-targeted transfers; that is an empirical question and the answer will undoubtedly vary across settings, belying the generalizations often heard from advocates.

30.631866,-17.412941,4,We illustrate how the desire to live in a fair society that rewards individual effort and hard work triggers an unselfish though rational demand for redistribution. This leads the well off to prefer higher taxes and the poor to reject extreme progressivity. We then provide evidence of these behaviors using a nationally representative survey from Italy. Our empirical analysis confirms that a stronger aversion to unfair distributive outcomes is associated with a higher support for redistribution by individuals with high income and to a lower demand for redistribution by those with low income.,https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12416,Fairness and the unselfish demand for redistribution by taxpayers and welfare recipients

A government committee recently recommended the introduction of a universal Basic Income Grant (BIG) to address this hole in the welfare net. Now that highly active antiretroviral thereapy (HAART) is being rolled out through the public health sector for people sick with AIDS, the case for a BIG is even more compelling. People sick with AIDS qualify for a disability grant. The HAART rollout offers them the chance of restored health – but it comes at the cost of losing the disability grant because they will be deemed well enough to work. Given South Africa's high unemployment rates, many will not be able to find work, and hence will face a trade-off between health (taking HAART) and income (keeping the disability grant). This could undermine adherence to HAART and/or reduce the effectiveness of the treatment by compromising the nutritional status of patients, thereby facilitating the growth of drug-resistant HIV.

The conception of justice implied by the party's version of a basic income is best understood against the backdrop of the ideas of social justice of the contemporary Brian Barry. Just as Barry, the Green party embraces a basic income out of concern for the safety of the least well off groups in society and out of concern for equality of opportunity.

This conception of social justice combines freedom, equality, and efficiency. It justifies granting to each citizen an unconditional basic income at the highest sustainable level consistent with two conditions: respect for everyone's formal freedom and an appropriate level of resources target at the less able. Is such an unconditional basic income not a recipe for exploitation of the hard workers by the lazy? Not in any sense that makes exploitation intrinsically unjust. Can a higher unconditional basic income be sustainably achieved under capitalism than under socialism? There are empirical and theoretical reasons to think so.

A basic income is an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. UBI differs from other existing benefits and appeals to a conception of social justice as the fair distribution of the real freedom to pursue the realization of one’s conception of the good life, whatever it is. Furthermore, UBI aims at being a remedy to both poverty and unemployment, and helps in pursuing the main objectives of feminism and environmental movements.

-1.904329,19.013454,2,"While the concept has been around for years, recently the policy notion of a “guaranteed basic income” (GBI)—or universal basic income—has had a resurgence of interest. In addition to rationales that relate to fairness and response to structural employment shifts due to automation and globalization, another motivation that is sometimes put forward for these plans is to encourage risk-taking by providing a safety net: There would be greater entrepreneurial activity if an unsuccessful entrepreneur had the GBI to fall back on. In this paper we investigate a rare long-standing example similar to a GBI in the US: the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend program. This was not put forth as a GBI, and the annual amount is too small to allow an individual to rely fully on these funds; but for a moderate-to-large family the APF can replace a large share of a poverty-level income. Receipt of the APF also does not preclude a family from receiving other safety net benefits—food stamps, unemployment compensation—which suggests that the downside risk for a potential entrepreneur may be lower than in other US states. We initially examine trends in small-firm births in Alaska over time from the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics 1977–2014—before and after the institution of the APF program (the first payment was in 1982)—relative to other US states to investigate a possible impact on entrepreneurship; the results suggest a positive effect—which appears to dissipate over time.

-7.60223,-26.051987,0,"Proponents recommend Universal Basic Income as a solution to a trifold crisis of work, wage and social democracy. Synthesising Marxian form analysis with Marxist-feminist social reproduction theory, this article suggests that these crises relate to historically specific capitalist social forms: labour, money and the state. These separate but interlocking crises of social form are temporary and contingent expressions of an underlying, permanent crisis of social reproduction. Mistaking the pervasive crisis of social reproduction in its totality for a temporary or contingent trifold crisis of work, wage or social democracy, Universal Basic Income proposals seek to solve it by moving through the same social forms through which they take effect, rather than confronting the social relations that constitute their antagonistic undertow and generate the crisis of social reproduction. The article considers two other solutions proposed to handle the deeper-rooted crisis with which Universal Basic Income grapples: Universal Basic Services and Universal Basic Infrastructure. Both propose non-monetary ways past the impasses of the Universal Basic Income, addressing much more directly the constrained basis of individual and collective reproduction that characterises capitalist social relations. But they retain a link with capitalist social forms of money and state that may serve to close rather than open the path to real alternatives. The article concludes that the contradictions these ‘abstract universals’ touch upon are best mediated through more bottom-up and struggle-based ‘concrete universals’ that address the manifold crises of work, wage and social democracy that undergird them. Such alternatives would leave open dynamic tensions around work and welfare in contemporary capitalism without promise of their incomplete resolution in the name of a false universality unattainable in a world characterised by antagonism, domination and crisis.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0309816819873323,"Social form, social reproduction and social policy: Basic income, basic services, basic infrastructure"

This framework is applied to estimate the intra-household distribution of income and the economies of sharing for Australian married couples over retirement age. The main clusions of the paper are that income is shared relatively evenly (and the hypothesis of equal sharing cannot be rejected), and that on average couples require about one and a half times the income of singles to reach the same living standard.

We find that there are only few countries where the activation discourse has remained a dead letter. Most countries implement policy measures that aim to discourage benefit dependency among MIP recipients. Nevertheless, behind the realities of activation strategies towards MIP recipients seldom lies the notion of active inclusion as defined by the European Commission.

In designing the set of proposals, I draw on the experience of reducing inequality in postwar E urope and on an analysis as to how the economic circumstances are now different in the twenty‐first century, highlighting the role of technical change and the rise in capital emphasized by P iketty. The proposed measures span many fields of policy, and are not confined to fiscal redistribution, encompassing science policy, competition policy, public employment, a guaranteed return on small savings, a capital endowment, as well as more progressive taxation of income and wealth transfers, and a participation income. Inequality is embedded in our social structure, and the search for a significant reduction requires us to examine all aspects of our society. I focus on inequality within countries, and what can be achieved by national governments, with the UK specifically in mind. The primary audience is those concerned with policy‐making in national governments, but implementation should not be seen purely in these terms. There are different levels of government, and certain proposals, particularly those concerned with taxation, may only be feasible if pursued by a group of countries in collaboration. The last of the twelve proposals – for a basic income for children – is specifically directed at the E uropean U nion.

32.447914,-32.48283,0,"This report argues that fundamental reform of the architecture of Australia's welfare system is needed to better capture evolving labour market and social changes, and proposes four pillars of reform. In December 2013, the Minister for Social Services, the Hon. Kevin Andrews MP, appointed an independent Reference Group to review Australia's welfare system. This is the Reference Group’s Interim Report. Mr Patrick McClure AO chairs the Reference Group. The other members are Mr Wesley Aird and Ms Sally Sinclair. The Reference Group was supported by a Taskforce in the Department of Social Services in preparing this report. Executive summary Government cash transfer payments to individuals and families represent the most significant component of Australia’s social support system in expenditure terms. The Department of Social Services has policy responsibility for income support payments and supplements worth around $100 billion in 2012–13. This is a significant investment with a wide reach across the community. Changes to Australia’s income support system over time have resulted in unintended complexities, inconsistencies and disincentives for some people to work. The system is also out of step with today’s labour market realities and community expectations. The income support system is in need of major reform to deliver better outcomes for all Australians now and into the future. Long-term reliance on income support increases the risks of poor health, low self-esteem and social isolation. It can also have intergenerational effects. Children who grow up in households with long periods on income support are more likely to have poor education, employment and social outcomes. In contrast, employment generates clear financial, health and social benefits for individuals, families and communities. To maximise employment and social outcomes, and to remain sustainable over the longer term, Australia’s income support system needs to have a stronger employment focus. It should provide adequate support while encouraging more people to work to their capacity. It should also be simpler and more coherent. While reforms in recent decades have increased participation expectations for income support recipients, a more fundamental reform of the architecture of the system is needed to better capture evolving labour market and social changes such as the growth in part-time work and the increased labour force participation of women. The broader social support system should work in tandem with the income support system to assist those most in need. This includes well-functioning employment services, housing assistance, child care, and early intervention and integrated services for people and families with complex needs, such as homelessness, mental health conditions and drug or alcohol addiction. Reform needs to take account of recent developments such as the system of lifelong care and support for people with disability being introduced through the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the expansion of paid parental leave and the opportunities offered by new technology. It should also take account of effective interventions to support people who are vulnerable in the labour market, such as people with mental health conditions and people with disability.

Starting from ch. 24 of Keynes' General Theory, we discuss how the keynesian conditions for a the development of a social pact between workers and entrepreneurs, with the intermediation by the State, are overcome by the structural change of the accumulation and valorisation process. Fordist new deal was based on three main variables: i) the existence of a State-nation able to implement nationalwide and autonomous political economies; ii) the possibility to measure productivity gains in material terms, and, iii) the existence of stable industrial relations, with high degree of representation of national differing social interests.

Further, the prevailing individual bargain on collective bargain negatively affects the relevance of industrial elations and especially the capacity of tradeunionism. The structural instability of CC could be minimize, first, by the introduction of a limit to intellectual property rights, able to socialize knowledge ad better exploit learning and network economics at the basis of accumulation process. Secondly, by the introduction of a basic income, able to compensate the unfair income distribution due to the capital gains allocation.

The few analyses which exist focus typically on one group—disabled people—and focus overwhelmingly on current income as the relevant measure of resources. This article extends existing analysis on both fronts, analysing conversion factors for a broader range of groups than are typically considered and estimating conversion factors using both a current and five-year average measure of income. It is found that conversion factors based on a five-year average of current income are 40–45% lower than those based on current income. However, a conversion-adjusted income measure, whether based on current or five-year average income, still does not reflect “command over capabilities” because conversion factors are estimated on the basis of group averages, while needs vary for different groups and different households.

The explanation   for this lays in the narrow definition, focusing almost entirely on   exclusion from paid employment that frames political concerns with   social exclusion in the UK. However, the policies designed to tackle   social exclusion even in this rather narrow approach should be of   concern to social work because it is possible that they will exacerbate   rather than tackle the exclusion that many social work clients face.     To explore these issues this paper draws   upon Penna’s (2001) argument that there is a tension between the desire   to tackle social exclusion at a national level and global economic   governance that constructs neo-liberalism as being the only way forward   to economic prosperity and stability because the operation of   neo-liberal political economy creates social exclusion. The paper   examines these tensions by focusing upon what Adler (2004) identifies as   a new model – the employment model – for the relief of poverty in the   UK.     The paper discusses the antecedents of the   employment model in the shift from Keynesianism to neo-liberalism. The   paper demonstrates that the employment model is concerned with   regulating a number dilemmas related to labour power and the wage   relation that have emerged from the acceptance of the global neo-liberal   economy as being the only viable economic paradigm.

In a time when individuals prefer to operate as autonomous individuals, being
dependent is often thought of as a negative state that is best overcome as soon as
possible (Lee, 2002; Stone, 2010). Political institutions have a similar view when
it comes to reliance on welfare services: welfare state services should support
people for as short as possible so as to ensure that they are able to carry on living
independently (Gilbert, 2004).
Whereas the insistence on independence from welfare support has been present
in US welfare politics from its beginning, it is relatively new in European welfare
states such as The Netherlands (Hemerijck, 2013). European welfare systems used
to be passive systems aimed at income maintenance but have transformed into
activating systems aimed at maximizing labor market employment by stressing
individual responsibility (Gilbert, 2004), and the Dutch welfare system forms no
exception to this rule (Hemerijck & Marx, 2010).
Due to the imminent unsustainability of generous social protection programs
given aging populations, European welfare states have been retrenching (Pavolini
& Ranci, 2008; Pierson, 2011). For many welfare states, this is a continuation of
the transformation of welfare states into activating systems.

It is essential to discuss feasibility, theoretical background, and contexts for the possible adoption of a UBI scheme; yet, these issues lie beyond the scope of this chapter. Rather, I will focus on one singular aspect of the UBI proposal, namely, the underlying vision for a profound social transformation. More precisely, I will draw upon the theories formulated by French philosopher and UBI proponent André Gorz, who imagined the introduction of a UBI as a chance to create societies with “(…) less employment and less selling of labor and services, but with growth in collective facilities and services, in nonmonetary exchange and self-providing” (Gorz 2013 [1997]: 299). While I do not intend to discuss the validity of this perspective in detail, it provides me with a framework for analyzing the activities and lifestyle of a contemporary activist network in Tokyo, whose members, in fact, share Gorz’s vision and have found their own particular way to answer the question of how to create a “better” society, and how this idea of “living beyond the wage-based society” can be put into practice.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137348081_10,Beyond the Paradigm of Labor: Everyday Activism and Unconditional Basic Income in Urban Japan

In the 1970s and 1980s, when an array of basic income schemes was proposed, some groups were supportive and others were opposed. This paper shows that, in a number of high-profile proposals in Canada and the US, behind the apparent dissensus among business groups lays a consensus stance against universalistic and unconditional guaranteed income schemes. The disagreement among business groups comes down to either (1) a basic misunderstanding of proposal details, or (2) the fact that the policy itself can take on a wide range of concrete forms. To the extent that business has exhibited support for guaranteed income policies, the actual policies in question tended to be “two-tiered” rather than unitary, selective rather than universal, and miserly rather than generous. The income maintenance policies that garnered some support among business groups would all include explicit or implicit work requirements for “able-bodied” adults. By contrast, generous, unconditional guaranteed income policies that reduce workers’ market dependence—namely, those that basic income advocates find desirable—found no audience in business circles.

(Boutang, 2011) Specifically, it tries to show how free labor involves into not only the generation of immaterial goods such as knowledge, information, culture, communication, relationship, and brand but also the production of various categories of material goods including motor cycles, medicines, musical instruments, and so on. In so doing, this paper explores how free labor of networked populations has been increasingly externalizing capital&rsquo;s management function from production processes and thus reinforcing the &lsquo;becoming rent of capital&rsquo;. (Vercellone, 2008) In addition, it enquires into the exploitation of free labor in conjunction with the notion of the voluntariness of labor and the immaterial compensation (e.g., reputation or peer recognition) that could be considered as major discursive resources for the reproduction of cognitive capitalism. Furthermore, by examining various strategies coping with the gratuitous dynamics of immaterial products facilitated by contemporary digital networking environments, this article tries to seek for a fair way to compensate for the free cognitive and affective labor. First, contents-vectoralists of music and film industries employ the legal device of &lsquo;Digital Rights Management (DRM)&rsquo; as a way to secure their profits. And thus, they are strengthening rent-seeking economy and constraining various forms of the long-standing cultural practices among populations. Second, &lsquo;Micropayment System&rsquo; is often regarded as a market-friendly solution to the gratuitous dynamics of digital labor by contents-vectoralists of journalism and publishing, many platform-vectoralists, and some libertarian consumer groups. Third, the concept of &lsquo;Universal Basic Income&rsquo; could be an effective social policy for the proper compensation for free labor in the sense that it extends the logic of social and common nature of production to the sphere of distribution. Background and Discussion Even though free labor in digital networks may not necessarily be unavoidable (Andrejevic, 2009), it still remains as an enforced labor in the sense that agreements of users on the terms of use set up by platform providers may be interpreted as a form of socially embedded enforcement. Furthermore, products of free labor are mostly put under a platform-vectoralists&rsquo; disposal. Similar to a contract of wage labor, users&rsquo; agreement on the terms of use enables platform providers to take a whole control over products of free labor. Indeed, private appropriation of social and common products of unpaid labor became a key object of exploitation in cognitive capitalism. So, here come two main reasons to think about a material compensation for free labor. First, even though much of free labor is not only performed by immaterial motivations such as a pursuit of technical perfection, an acquirement of reputational capital, and the spread of commonism but also compensated in an immaterial manner, it is far from the socio-economic norm of a fair distribution of wealth that platform-vectoralists appropriate the value created by free labor as a form of rent. Second, it is much more necessary to compensate for free labor in a material manner so as to secure the sustainability of cognitive capitalism itself that strives to retain sources of capital accumulation from the creative and innovative free labor among networked populations. The private appropriation of free labor has long been pursued by contents-vectoralists with an ownership of intellectual property rights and DRM might be deemed to be the most recent technological device for that purpose. DRM is mainly led by contents-vectoralists such as Disney, Warner Brothers, EMI, Microsoft, and Amazon and supported by major manufacturers of electronics including Sony, Samsung, Apple, IBM, Panasonic, and so on. Although contents-vectoralists have been trying to limit networked populations&rsquo; free access to ideas and information by introducing DRM, this privatization of digital commons may result in the blocking of creativity and innovation that are vital to the reproduction of cognitive capitalism. With regard to the notion of &lsquo;Micropayment System&rsquo;, some argue for charging all information, knowledge, and culture that is shared on the Internet free of charge and Micropayment System often considered as a proper way to compensate monetarily those who contributed to value creation in digital networks. In spite of the past failures of start-ups such as BitPass, FirstVirtual, Cybercoin, Millicent, Digicash, Internet Dollar, and Pay2See, some newspapers actively seek for a building of payment system to each news articles so as to relieve the company&rsquo;s financial burden. New York Times and Financial Times are currently running &lsquo;Metered Paywalls&rsquo; model and many more newspaper capitals are expected to join the track. And &lsquo;Google Wallet&rsquo; seems to providing a new momentum for the spread of Micropayment System. Meanwhile, it constitutes another reason for the idea of Micropayment System that many criticize platform-vectoralists such as Google and Facebook for their monopolization of the profits coming from the use of huge user-generated data on the Internet. Several social network services (e.g. Teckler, Pheed, Datacoup) actually run the business model which get back some of their profit to their users as a form of payment for using their personal data. Even some consumer activists refuse the highly common and idealized concept of &lsquo;freedom of information&rsquo; and &lsquo;free information&rsquo; since it enables, to a great extent, platform-vectoralists with a huge networking power to use and capture users&rsquo; value-creating activities free of charge. So, in order to realize information economy in which a new middle-class can emerge, we need, some argue, to renounce the familiar concept of &lsquo;free information&rsquo; and to employ a universal Micropayment System. (Lanier, 2013), However, Micropayment System, on the one hand, must disentangle a very complicate matter of ownership of immaterial goods and, on the other hand, inevitably require the establishment of an highly intensive digital surveillance system. Thus, this market-oriented solution for the compensation could not serve as a viable alternative. Conclusions Basic Income, as a way for a social and common compensation, may be able to deal with failures of rent-seeking economy developing in the sphere of culture and information beyond the realm of natural resources. It may also play a significant role in the realization and spread of social value of a common cultural inheritance. The concept of Basic Income is often justified in two different ways. First, all economic wealth and value is generated by social cooperation. That is, the creation of wealth should be considered not in terms of the product of individuals&rsquo; laboring power but in terms of social bond and cooperation among individuals. Therefore, every individual is deemed to retain the right to acquire wealth from these social and common resources. Second, key elements of production (e.g. tools, technology, and knowledge) belong to a communal cultural tradition and human heritage. So, we are all just cultural inheritors of human community and have to right to receive dividends. These two justifications of Basic Income seem to have a great relevance to today&rsquo;s cognitive capitalism. Its accumulation regime greatly relies upon the production of immaterial goods such as information, knowledge, and culture and its mode of production increasingly focuses on cooperation among networked populations. Furthermore, given the increasing flexibilization of employment relationships and differentiation between internal and external labor markets, universal Basic Income may play a crucial role in relieving the instability of cognitive capitalism.

-24.667612,21.013586,2,"The ability of public policies to secure the economic and social rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is proposed as a trumping supplement to the utilitymaximization criterion of neo-classical welfare economics. Two progressive proposals for ending poverty and promoting personal development and freedom are then compared using this assessment criterion. The first proposal is that society guarantee everyone an unconditional basic income (BI) without imposing work requirements in exchange for the guarantee. The second proposal is that society use direct job creation to provide employment assurance (EA) for anyone who is unable to find decent work in the economy’s regular labor market. The cost of equally expansive versions of the two strategies is compared along with their ability to achieve other policy goals. It is argued that a BI guarantee would be far more expensive than the EA strategy as a means of securing the right to income recognized in the Universal Declaration, that a BI guarantee would not provide an adequate substitute for securing the right to work, and that most of the other benefits a BI guarantee would produce could be better achieved at less cost by using the EA strategy supplemented by conventional income transfer programs. Based on this analysis it is argued that efforts to promote the BI idea as a solution to the problems of unemployment and poverty in market societies should be rejected. On the other hand, less expensive versions of the BI idea could make a valuable contribution to the design of income transfer measures as long as they were not treated as a substitute for policies designed to secure the right to work and income support recognized in the Universal Declaration.

There have been heated discussions on the benefits and costs of adopting basic income as a universal income support program among policy makers and academics in South Korea. However, one of the problems in the discourse of basic income discussion in South Korea has been a lack of clear definition of basic income. In this study, we develop a basic income fidelity index (BIFI) that can be applied to basic income programs to show how fully a program fits to the basic income concept. Such an index can be useful in making the terminologies and concepts of basic income clearer. We test feasibility of BIFI by applying it to four different case examples of basic income; Alaska Permanent Fund, UK Child Trust Fund, Switzerland’s Basic Income Plan, and Finland’s Basic Income Experiment. We show BIFI can be a useful tool to differentiate various types of basic income.

The classic statement is Milton Friedman’s “negative income tax” proposal from Capitalism and Freedom (1962). In Friedman’s scheme, individuals earning an income beneath a certain threshold receive the difference between their income and that threshold rather than paying taxes. A basic income guarantee (BIG) differs only in that it pays an amount equal to that threshold to everyone regardless of income up front, balancing the outlay through taxes afterwards. Charles Murray (2006, 2008) has defended it as a potential compromise between libertarians and liberals as a measure replacing the welfare state. Hayek (1960: 376), while lambasting proposals to engineer the overall pattern of income distribution, defends the idea of a minimum income floor, one of the primary aims of basic income advocates.

-13.954292,17.484583,2,"Regarding the prospects of a transformation of income-security programmes into a universal and unconditional minimum income scheme, Belgium and the Netherlands are of particular interest. Since the early 1980s, one can find in the ‘low countries’ some of the most prominent proponents of a basic income (BI), i.e. “an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement” (Van Parijs 2000). In no other advanced welfare state the BI debate has been so broad and lively than in the Netherlands. Since 1975, the idea of a basisinkomen has been discussed within many Dutch political parties, trade unions, social organisations, and even at the governmental level. It was at the core of various official reports that progressively increased its respectability in political circles. Belgian political actors have always been more reluctant to it, with the noteworthy exception of the two green parties. But the academic discussion has been quite extensive. The founding congress and second international conference of the Basic Income European Network (BIEN) were held in Belgium, respectively in 1986 and 1988. In 1999, a Belgian political formation named ‘Vivant’ was launched as the first European single-issue party entirely focused on BI. Although it remains a tiny player in Belgium’s political game, it managed to attract public attention on the proposal through eye-catching posters in the country’s main cities. In this chapter, I will scrutinise the political chances of BI in the low countries and the probability of incremental steps into that direction. In the Section 1, assuming that a BI would replace most existing means-tested minimum income schemes, I will briefly review the main social assistance programmes of both countries. I shall try to demonstrate that a paradigm shift is underway which may at first sight seriously undermine the progress to a more universal and unconditional income-security system. In fact, as it is the case of many other European countries, Belgium and the Netherlands are in the process of restructuring their welfare states along ‘activation’ lines. Even if effective retrenchment remained limited to date, work requirements have been more strictly enforced with the passing years. Partly based on interviews and an extensive review of the press, Section 2 will be devoted to an account of more than twenty-five years of BI debate in both countries. The Dutch discussion already started in the mid-1970s, whereas the idea only appeared in 1985 in Belgium’s public debate. Even if the Dutch BI proponents were politically more powerful, in both countries the numerous BI advocates always failed to gain longlasting political support for their proposal. But in addressing questions of universality and conditionality, they managed to have an influence on the terms of the welfare reform discussions. Section 3 of this chapter will then focus on the very reasons of this failure to gain political support, which are of paramount importance for the future prospects of unconditional minimum income schemes. Starting from the hypothesis that under certain conditions a BI would be economically sustainable, most participants in the debate stress that four important obstacles have been in the way of the proposal. As is argued in some detail, the moral objection to an income by right without a related duty to work seems to be the most decisive impediment. Finally, in the conclusions I shall try to clarify why, given the obstacles and objections they encountered, most",,Basic Income in Belgium and the Netherlands: Implementation Through the Back Door?

Results illustrate the challenges, but also the strengths, of existing social protection systems.

The core of our analysis is centred on evaluating how each proposal might address poverty in B.C. along intersectional lines, and according to the key dimensions or principles of poverty mitigation and prevention outlined by the B.C. government in its poverty reduction strategy: affordability, opportunity, reconciliation, and social. We also draw on insights regarding the systemic barriers that contribute to greater risk and prevalence of poverty for people whose identities are situated at various axes of difference. We not only consider how the proposals may produce “tangible” outcomes, but also focus on the various ways in which they could transform experiences within and beyond the system of programs, or erect barriers that are not immediately obvious or that may not exist for a “neutral” subject. We demonstrate that the basic income and basic services approaches both have immediate practical value, as well as exhibiting transformative potential, though such impacts largely hinge on how the policies are envisioned and implemented.

This paper draws on Marxist political economy in order to demonstrate how the emancipatory potential of UBI has been somewhat overstated by some of its Leftist supporters, while a discussion of the neutrality of the State is important in considering how this ‘shape-shifting social policy' is likely to be implemented in practice.",https://doi.org/10.1177/02610183221092151,‘The Left will find that it has bought a Trojan Horse’: The dialectics of universal basic income

Growth takes place in terms of monetary flows, financial assets and transactions, capital accumulation; in terms of aggregate material throughput, infrastructure, desires, efficiency and productivity. It is equally promoted by those who call for austerity as well as those who advocate Keynesianism. The final result is often the same. Problems are shifted in space and time. The growth fetish, however, will not go away by ignoring it, but by creating the necessary political, social and economic conditions for managing and living well without growth. Degrowth, unlike what the term may suggest to the uninitiated, is not a technical economic term, meaning the opposite of growth. While it denounces GDP growth, its focus lies on changing the context and the units of measurement, or reference. The thorny goal of reducing consumption within degrowth is driven by principles of political organization in the spirit of caring for the commons, voluntary simplicity, and conviviality. Our hypothesis is that there is little to lose from embarking on a degrowth trajectory. On the contrary, only by dropping the growth fetish (now) can emissions be stabilized and extreme events prevented from menacing livelihoods. We empirically demonstrate here that the discomforts associated with living in a state of climatic instability cannot be offset by monetary growth.

Augmented UI benefits fully replaced earnings for the majority of recipients who lost jobs. And the PPP aided the continuity of the small business sector and boosted employment at a modest pace. Overall, Bi and Gulati find that the fiscal policy response to the pandemic largely benefitted segments of the economy most in need, but the long-term effects from these programs remain to be seen.",https://doi.org/10.18651/er/v106n2bigulati,Fiscal Relief during the COVID-19 Pandemic

I answer this question with a quantitative model to assess the general equilibrium, inequality, and welfare effects of substituting the current US income security system with a universal basic income (UBI) policy. To do so, I develop an overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic income risk that incorporates intensive and extensive margins of the labor supply, on-the-job learning, and child-bearing costs. The tax-transfer system closely mimics the US design. I calibrate the model to the US economy and conduct counterfactual analyses that implement reforms toward a UBI. I find that an expenditure-neutral reform has moderate impacts on agents’ labor supply response but induces aggregate capital and output to grow due to larger precautionary savings. A UBI of $1,000 monthly requires a substantial increase in the tax rate of consumption used to clear the government budget and leads to an overall decrease in the macroeconomic aggregates, stemming from a drop in the labor supply. In both cases, the economy has more equally distributed disposable income and consumption.

The model is formulated in terms of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, each of which gives account of how the number of individuals in a certain income class changes in time. Societies ruled by different fiscal systems (with no taxes, with taxation and redistribution, with a welfare system) are considered and the effect of the presence of a basic income in the various cases is analysed by means of numerical simulations. The main findings are that basic income effectively acts as a tool of poverty alleviation: indeed, in its presence the portion of individuals in the poorest classes and economic inequality diminish. Of course, the issue of a universal basic income in the real world is more complex and involves a variety of aspects. The goal here is simply to show how mathematical models can help in forecasting scenarios resulting from one or the other policy.",https://doi.org/10.3390/a14110331,A Mathematical Model of Universal Basic Income and Its Numerical Simulations

It ventures into propelling that a reliance on this social cushion (in isolation from other income generating mechanisms) to enhance the economic position of the caregiver ‘the hand’ is self-defeating. The caregiver as the recipient holds the decision making power that determines how resources are cascaded at the level of the household therefore in implementation of social protection interventions of this nature, the policy focus should not exclusively be directed at the children but also at those who are responsible for the care of the children. In predominant situations of vast unemployment and lack of sources of income and provision, the CSG becomes a source of sustenance for the entire household, to all intents and purposes it meets only the most basic needs. It then becomes hardly surprising that even though there is a high take up of Child Support Grants, the majority of South African children continue to experience poverty in the form of both income and material deprivation.
The findings of this study will allow concerned stakeholders including government and civil society to critically assess and adjust polices on how to best maximise the benefits of social assistance within the South African historical and current context. It is envisioned that some recommendations that have emerged will contribute to the debate ensuing around the structural and institutional mechanisms that should shape social protection in South Africa.

It starts by describing three effects of basic income. The first is that it will raise the incomes of the least advantaged. The second is that it will protect against the threats of exploitation and abuse. The third is that it will remove one obstacle to finding employment. The chapter then explains the significance of these effects by drawing on ideas about distributive justice, emphasizing the relevance of John Rawls’s justice as fairness and Elizabeth Anderson’s democratic equality. It also considers the claim that basic income should be rejected because it would require the state to interfere with the lives of those who would be taxed to fund it, arguing that it is a mistake to oppose taxation in such a wholesale way.

The unions’ policy concepts of work and working time have been largely adapted to these revisions. However, the unions’ conceptualizations of the future development of incomes and the social transfer system seem to be much less in line with the new concept of full employment: Does the renunciation of income increases suffice to fully capitalize on the employment effects of envisioned working time reductions? And doesn’t the unions’ unconditional insistence on the social insurance approach, that is based on the formerly dominant standard employment relationship of male workers, contravene the intended structural change of work and income?

In the first, Sheila Shaver reviews the conflicting arguments for Participation Income and Basic Income, both of which claim to represent extensions of the social citizenship of the welfare state required for a post-industrial society. The paper reviews the reforms introduced in the Working Nation White Paper, and suggests that these are part of a large scale historical shift in the character of the Australian welfare state. While social rights of citizenship such as income support were previously complementary to employment and capital accumulation, they are now becoming integrated into the processes of economic growth and development. The paper by Peter Saunders focuses on Basic Income (BI) and two key issues which must be addressed in all such proposals, conditionality and transition. Conditionality refers to the definition of those circumstances under which people are entitled to receive income support benefits. BI proposals have also given insufficient attention to the problems associated with the transition to such a scheme, and in particular to the political influence of estimates of winners and losers. Advocates of a Participation Income such as Atkinson and Cass accept some degree of conditionality as the price of BI at an adequate benefit level; this paper offers an alternative proposal for a low level but fully unconditional BI, which is considered a more promising approach to the problems of transition.",,Two Papers on Citizenship and Basic Income

It is a type of minimum income guarantee that differs from those that now exist in various European countries. Considered in its pure form, a basic in-come is paid (1) to individuals rather than households; (2) irrespective of wealth or any in-come from other sources; and (3) without requiring the performance of any work or the will-ingness to accept a job if offered. Its relevance to the problems of contemporary welfare states has long been recognized. From the 1970s onwards, forms of basic income have been regu-larly proposed for adapting the post-war institutions of social transfer to the conditions of a modern economy, in which lifetime security through earned income is no longer the norm. The guiding claim was that an unconditional floor of guaranteed income is justified as the fairest and the most efficient way of reconstructing basic security in the welfare state. Inevita-bly, the fairness part of this claim led to a principled debate concerning the unconditional features of basic income, in particular the absence of the requirement of willingness to work. The reason for this is obvious, for any moral justification of unconditional basic income has to deal with the objection that it is unfair to hand out transfers to able-bodied persons who are merely unwilling to earn a living. This theme has been explored in depth in Arguing for Basic Income (1992). This book is divided in two distinct but interrelated parts, both of which reflect the main topics of the 1998 Congress of the Basic Income European Network.

There are three policy choices to resolve this issue: (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work, and (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason. Of these choices, article 8 of the Part-time Labor Act adopts (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, and the Democratic Party of Japan's manifesto (2009) extols the basic principle of same pay for same work (one form of (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work). A general legal principle based on a particular form (same career or same work) is not applicable to other types of employment systems and creates the problem of not being able to address the various benefits not directly connected to career or work duties, such as commuting allowance, in-house cafeterias, and health examinations.

With an assumption of diverse and broad benefits for employees and diversified and multi-track human resource systems (wage systems), Japan has also adopted (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason; responses that incorporate diversity of particular situations for determining objective reason are likely appropriate in terms of theory and practice. In this paper, I clarify in concrete terms the details and nature of this principle (in particular, guidelines for interpreting objective reason and the concrete framework for decisions) while looking at various aspects such as the debate in France and Germany and show how to respond to problems in implementing this principle (low predictability).",,Is Equivalent Wages for Equivalent Work an Illusion?: Legal principles for eliminating the disparity between regular and non-regular employees (Japanese)

On this view Government as a guarantor of basic human rights, has the responsibility to intervene with universal public policies, heterogeneous and comprehensive to provide a minimum of welfare for all citizens.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the change in public policies approach in Argentina and Government role through the analysis of the Universal Child Allowance for Social Protection (AUH, 2009) and its extension to the Pregnancy Allowance for Social Protection (AxE, 2011). This measure seeks to provide access to social protection in cases where the labor path is not necessarily formal, showing a shift in social protection policies.

In Argentina, the AUH has as a short term goal to reduce the poverty, extreme poverty and inequity and to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by encouraging the formation of human capital through health and education conditionalities and coordination with programs that contribute to the realization of rights, as the Plan Nacer and the Conectar Igualdad”.

Given that media coverage of poverty alleviation in the United States generally follows an episodic frame, which puts focus on individuals and their particular circumstances (i.e. lifestyle choices), while major Canadian media generally shows a mix of frames, results of a media content analysis at the local level shows basic-income pilot was covered mainly through thematic frames, which emphasizes systemic factors and more general social conditions, which support state action on basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0048,Against the Frame: Local Media Coverage of Ontario’s Basic Income Pilot

This being the situation, in which we can consider the problem of unemployment as being long-term and widespread, there are three possible sceneries, each having their own particular interventional policies. Policies of the first sort aim to change the supply for work both through a radical deregulation of the industrial relationship system, and through a reduction in social expenses. The second possible scenery proceeds from the belief that an increasing demand for private goods and services is inadequate, and suggests solutions that rely on the demand for goods, while developing at the same time the advanced infrastructures and the supply for collective services. Meades notion of Citizen's Income represents the third alternative scenery, where the social contract is no longer founded on the right to a job, but on the right to an income. The introduction of the idea of Citizen's Income could favour the distinction of productivity from security problems, it would inable considering work not as a condemnation, but rather as a matter choice, motivated by profit or direct utility; favouring a more liberal production of collective goods thereby limiting a too intrusive political power, while increasing those liberties granted to citizens.",,Are the solutions to the high unemployment puzzle

Individuals differ along the two most important dimensions when it comes to the design of the two welfare schemes, namely, income and risk. Even though the introduction of a basic income scheme opens up the possibility for additional redistribution, it also crowds out social health insurance. We show that when both welfare schemes are open for debate, the political equilibrium is such that only the basic income scheme prevails. At the constitutional stage we determine which welfare scheme society agrees to implement behind the veil of ignorance and with a Rawlsian objective. Since social health insurance not only redistributes income from rich to poor but also from low-risk to high-risk agents, the doubly disadvantaged in society – low-income and high-risk agents – may lose out in the political process when a basic income scheme is in place. Depending on the amount of health care expenditure and the inequalities in income and risk, it may well be that a society will find it optimal to set up an institutional framework for a social health insurance scheme only.",,The Political Sustainability of a Basic Income Scheme and Social Health Insurance

Some of the consequences mentioned: redistribution among subsequent generations (which raises special ethical questions besides the obvious empirical ones); creation of artificial externalities on individual efforts to raise children (which, as a consequence, leads to intra-generational redistribution by number of children raised as well as to declining fertility); and the impact on the conditions of long-term survival of the resource reallocation system (as the various ?golden rules? of resource reallocations are constantly hurt by making the system exposed to frequent political corrections).",,Intragenerációs újraelosztás gyermekszám szerint = Intra-generational redistribution by number of children

The unconditional basic income in the form of a negative income tax is therefore discussed and tentatively developed. It is suggested that the negative income tax should be granted unconditionally and individually to all legal and permanent residents without the obligation of services in return. Besides the negative lump sum tax, a lump sum supplement should be granted for caregivers, honorary workers and people incapable of working. Based on a person’s own income a positive tax should be counted against the negative income tax. With the implementation of the suggested model of a negative income tax, basic (financial) needs could be secured and the tax and transfer system could be harmonized, whereby administration effort could be reduced and poverty traps avoided. It is stressed that for the implementation of a comprehensive model of a negative income tax all relevant parameters as well as possible impacts need to be investigated cautiously; suggestions of this thesis therefore need to be seen as a first attempt. The attitude towards an unconditional basic income furthermore influences its successful implementation.

I conclude that marriage partners are not scarce in principle: that is, it is possible to craft first-best arrangements that guarantee everyone a fair chance to marry.

20.882442,-16.406822,4,"Tony Pearce outlines what you should know about income replacement policies. Income replacement insurance provides an income should you be prevented from working because of sickness or injury. These are commonly known as permanent health insurance or PHI schemes. The word ‘permanent’ in the name refers to the fact that the policyholder is the only person who can stop the cover during the term of the policy (this would be through the nonpayment of premiums or cancelling the policy directly). The insurance company cannot withdraw cover, under any other circumstance, once the contract has been accepted and premiums have commenced. These plans pay you an income, usually equivalent to 50–65% of your usual salary, if you are unable to work for a long period. The income is generally paid until you reach your usual retirement age but will automatically cease if you return to work before this point. If you are self-employed then the benefits under the plan are calculated based on the amount of your taxable income or profits, normally for the 12 months before you become unable to work. Care should be taken to check what the insurance company means by disability. It generally is better to consider a plan that pays the benefit if you are unable to carry out your usual occupation, referred to as ‘own occupation’ cover. Some plans will only pay a benefit if you are so sick or disabled that you cannot work at all. It is far less likely you will be unable to do any work than you will be unable to continue your usual occupation. The income from a PHI plan or scheme is tax free (hence the restriction to 50–65% of your usual income), but any income you receive may have an impact on any state incapacity benefit that you wish to claim. There can also be situations where the employed people can afford to set longer deferral periods, as their employers will pay them during the early months of a long-term illness. The self-employed should think carefully about the appropriate period of time of the deferral period. If you are employed, check the level and structure of any sickness pay arrangements offered by your employer. Often employers will pay your salary for a given time before decreasing or perhaps stopping it altogether. This will allow you to work out the deferral period most appropriate to your circumstances. Ideally you would claim benefits from the policy at the end of the period where your employer provides income. This would ensure you always have sufficient income, from either your employer or the policy, to provide for your needs. Check the wording of all policies, especially the insurer’s definition of disability. You should consider any restrictions that are placed upon the type of work you might be allowed to do were you unable to continue your normal employment. Certain occupations are statistically more likely to cause illness or accidents, this means the risk of a policyholder making a claim is greater for the insurer. This extra risk has two ways of showing itself, either through higher premiums for such occupations or in a greater number of restrictions under the policy. Managers are average risk, but nurses and care assistants are higher than average risk as statistically they are more likely to be off work with manual handlinginduced injuries. Some insurance companies do not charge extra for certain occupations, and a financial adviser can give guidance on this matter.

While future economic growth should continue to reduce poverty, it will not solve the problem by itself; thus, there is a potentially important role for national-level transfer programs that assist poor families in developing countries. Such programs are often run by developing country governments. Many countries have implemented transfer programs that seek to target beneficiaries: that is, to identify who is poor and then to restrict transfers to those individuals. Some people have begun to advocate for “universal basic income” programs, which dispense with trying to identify the poor and instead provide transfers to everyone. We begin by considering the universal basic income as part of the solution to an optimal income-taxation problem, focusing on the case of developing countries, where there is limited income data and inclusion in the formal tax system is low. We examine how the targeting of transfer programs is conducted in these settings, and provide empirical evidence on the tradeoffs involved between universal basic income and targeted transfer schemes using data from Indonesia and Peru—two countries that run nationwide transfer programs that are targeted to the poor.

8.515967,35.045837,4,"Household saving is still little understood, and even the basic facts â€“ for instance: How does saving change over the life cycle? Does saving turn negative in old age? â€“ are controversial. Understanding saving behavior is not only an important question of economic theory because the division of income in consumption and saving concerns one of the most fundamental household decisions, but it is also of utmost policy relevance. One reason is that private household saving as a private insurance interacts with social policy as public insurance. Population ageing and its threat to the sustainability of the public insurance systems have put the spotlight back on own saving as a device for old-age provision. Solving the pension crises therefore requires understanding saving. Another reason is growth: capital accumulation through saving increases economic growth directly, and indirectly through changes in labor productivity. The topic of household savings is by no means uncharted territory. Recent comprehensive surveys of the work on saving include Deaton (1992), Browning and Lusardi (1996), and Attanasio (1999). These surveys illustrate the many challenges the theory faces in matching the empirical facts about saving as well as the need to use micro data to understand saving behavior. This volume adds a distinctive international dimension to these studies of saving. It presents the results of the International Savings Comparison Project â€“ a project performed under the auspices of a European Union sponsored network of researchers.4 The main focus of this project is the interaction of household saving with public policy, notably the generosity of public pension systems. In this sense, our work is very much in the tradition of Feldsteinâ€™s (1974) seminal study. However, we transpose the inference from time series data to a set of international panel data drawn from six country studies. These studies analyze household saving in four European countries â€“ Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom â€“ and in Japan and the United States.",,Saving Viewed from a Cross-National Perspective
26.289867,4.4374633,4,"It is argued in this paper that post-Keynesian input-output models are particularly well suited for studying certain aspects of social sustainability, notably unemployment, the distribution of income, and fiscal sustainability (i.e. public debt). In order to illustrate this argument, a post-Keynesian input-output model for the German economy is constructed, incorporating the input-output structure of the German economy and a full representation of the circular flow of income between institutional sectors. In line with post-Keynesian theory, final demand consists of autonomous and induced components. In the household sector, two types of households are distinguished according to their main income source (labour or capital income). The model is used to explore the effects of two possible policy measures. The first is a shift from material consumption (industrial products) to immaterial consumption (services). The second is a massive investment programme in energy-saving technologies. The model suggests that these policy measures do not generally improve all indicators of sustainability. In the first case, unemployment is reduced, but the income share of capital rises at the expense of labour. While the increase in employment is beneficial, the associated increase in poverty among worker households is problematic for social sustainability. These findings provide further support for adopting a multi-dimensional approach to sustainability and illustrate that post-Keynesian input-output models can make a useful contribution to studying certain aspects of social sustainability, especially those involving structural change in the distribution of consumption expenditure and income.",,What can post-Keynesian input-output models tell us about social sustainability?

-15.606592,33.17938,3,"Concerns about social and economic impacts of recent austerity policies have reinvigorated debates about a “basic income” (BI). BI is a transfer payment given to all without conditions of labor sufficient for a certain reasonable standard of living. The long-running BI debate, however, has tended to overlook an important but related issue: the need for low-cost credit options to those on low incomes. A wide range of arguments have been offered in favor of BI. As Standing (2008, p. 1) suggests, a BI helps in “combatting poverty and economic insecurity,” by promoting job-searching and skills development. A more radical recent argument by Monnier and Vercellone (2014) sees BI in terms of being attached to social rights. This is highlighted in their statement, BI as the “counterpart to social labor that is not remunerated today,” and hence not welfare but “a new universal and unconditional right” (Monnier & Vercellone, 2014, pp. 60–61).",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137535320_6,Consumption Smoothing with Basic Income: The Role of Administrative Loans
8.964921,23.580746,2,"Neutralists have argued that there is something illiberal about linking access to gift-like resources to work requirements. The central liberal motivation for basic income is to provide greater freedom to choose between different ways of life, including options attaching great importance to non-market activities and disposable time. As argued by Philippe Van Parijs, even those spending their days surfing should be fed. This article examines Van Parijs' dual commitment to a ‘real libertarian’ justification of basic income and the public enforcement of a strong work ethos, which serves to boost the volume of work at a given rate of taxation. It is argued (contra Van Parijs) that this alliance faces the neutrality objection: the work ethos will largely offset the liberal gains of unconditionality by radically restricting the set of permissible options available. A relaxed, non-obligatory ethos might avoid this implication. This view, however, is vulnerable to the structural exploitation objection: feasibility is achieved only because some choose to do necessary tasks to which most people have the same aversion. In light of these objections, the article examines whether there is a morally untainted feasibility path consistent with liberal objectives.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1470594x10386569,"Should surfers be ostracized?

-43.40507,-21.368742,2,"Abstract An explicit unconditional basic income linked with a proportional tax rate and corresponding negative income tax schedule are generally thought to produce an equal distribution of incomes. They are so to say mathematically uniform systems. If we try to implement these schedules on an existing system of social transfers and taxes, the results may nevertheless be different. One problem is that taxes are generally calculated on yearly basis but social transfers are paid on monthly or even daily basis. There can be also other differences in the implementation. In this paper a simulation experiment with the Finnish tax and transfer system is presented. Two levels of basic income are defined: a normal basic income for adults over 18 years and a bit higher basic income (basic pension) for pensioners. Two alternative simulations are made: one corresponding to an unconditional basic income model and the other corresponding to the idea of negative income tax.

There are various proposals for an alternative to the current welfare system. First, I examine the philosophy that all able adult citizens have a responsibility to do socially useful work, but they should also have the right to an adequate income. The French social philosopher and journalist Andre Gorz and the Brandeis University social welfare professor David Gil, who have put forward visionary proposals for an ideal society based on the philosophy, hold this philosophy. Gorz maintains that automation and the electronic revolution have resulted in widespread unemployment and a flexible labor force, with few jobs remaining secure. As industrial jobs have shrunk and service jobs have increased, Gorz predicts that “more than 80 percent of us will earn our living by offering services to others.”1 Therefore, Gorz says, 
If we wish to maintain order, we may no longer reserve the right to an income to those citizens only who have jobs, nor even make the level of income dependent on the number of hours worked. Hence the idea of an income that would be guaranteed to every man and woman independently of work done….

Finally, empirical information collected in Belgium, Canada, and the Netherlands is used to test the robustness of the theoretical assumptions.

-17.915699,42.470745,3,"Typically, a basic income guarantee (BIG) is defended either on the grounds that it decouples the ability to live a fulfilling life from the obligation to work (Van Parijs, 1991), or that it is a more palatable social safety net than traditional welfare programs (Handler and Babcock, 2006). These can be thought of as philosophical and microeconomic avenues of approach, respectively, and each is amply represented in this book. A somewhat less common framework for thinking about a BIG is to consider it as a macroeconomic policy. Examples of this approach include Mitchell and Watts (2004), who compare the macroeconomic consequences of a BIG to those of a job guarantee program, and Moutos and Scarth (2003), who consider the operation of a BIG in both an open and a closed economy. This chapter argues that the macroeconomic perspective is critical, given the dramatic and broadly distributed changes in household income resulting from a BIG, as well as its highly predictable structure.

Using India as an illustration, the paper discusses the trade-offs that need to be recognized in adopting a UBI in these contexts. It shows that replacing the 2011 Public Distribution System (PDS) with a UBI results in losses for many low-income households, although much of this can be reduced by recycling the “out-of-system” PDS losses and the fiscal savings from excluding the highest-income groups as higher UBI transfers. In contrast, replacing inefficient energy subsidies—raising energy prices to efficient levels to internalize the negative environmental externalities of energy consumption—could simultaneously deliver unambiguous distributional gains, help address fiscal pressures, and improve energy efficiency with associated environmental and health gains.

The necessity of adequate living standards under limited resources raises a complicated problem for governments to provide appropriate distributing mechanism among the most vulnerable sections of the population. The paper analysed the concept of absolute basic income, which in some EU countries is considered as a substitution for a modern system of social security. Inequality of incomes creates not only a social problem but it is also an obstacle in the way of economic growth. It leads to the conclusion that government should provide some strategy to avoid high inequality. The model of rational individual with certain basic income is under investigation. The analysis of the model suggests that the presence of additional income not only facilitates more effective involvement of individuals to work, but it is a sort of indisputable factor for guaranteeing freedom of individuals and increasing their mutual respect. Thus, the idea of basic income, which spreads among European countries, has not only economic, but also political and psychological components that may affect the mentality of people in future.

Its transformation into a Social Integration Income (SII) in 2003 and its retrenchment in the period of the Great Recession and troika austerity (2011–2015) has reduced the scope of this policy measure as a universal safety net policy. This article examines the context and the major drivers for the creation and for the policy changes that occurred in the GMI/SII. Looking at the political debates and the changes in this policy measure along this period, we argue that the major reforms introduced since its creation reflect ideological cleavages within the political arena. Considering the very low share in total government current expenditure of GMI/SII, this can explain the social policy selective retreat associated to the changes introduced in this policy measure by the centre‐right coalition in government, in the latest period of cost containment of social policy in Portugal, leading to a great decrease in the number of beneficiaries and to an increase of its inadequacy.",https://doi.org/10.1111/spol.12604,The guaranteed minimum income in Portugal: A universal safety net under political and financial pressure

13.758342,33.600258,4,"Summary This paper presents, through highlighting and discussing its goals and key principles, a policy proposal – written on behalf of Caritas and presented in 2011 – to introduce in Italy, and especially in the Lombardy Region, a minimum income scheme, whose designation is Capability Income (Lodigiani and Riva, 2011). The proposal intended to be primarily a platform for useful discussion, in order to let civil society and policy makers evaluate, from a cultural, political as well as institutional perspective, the opportunity of establishing a “selective universalism” measure to fight poverty and social exclusion. Then, the paper highlights the organizational and implementation details, which are necessarily designed according to the specificity of the Lombardy welfare regime, but are surely transferrable to other models of local welfare. Above all, it discusses the rationale of the proposal, starting from the idea that the fight against poverty is “constituent”, in the true meaning of the word, as it forms not only the model of the welfare state but also of the society itself. The Capability Income invites to give priority on the political agenda to the fight to poverty and social exclusion and to embrace an “active inclusion” strategy. It states the right to be supported against the risk of poverty and social exclusion as a real and true right of citizenship, not subjected either to political will or to a compassionate and stigmatizing reading of the poor. Then, it identifies the most appropriate response to poverty in an “enabling” approach, which intervenes on the conditions that prevent the fulfilment of life. It provides for in cash and, above all, in kind benefits, so as to guarantee anyone the opportunity to enjoy “substantial freedom”, as suggested by the “capability approach”. Indeed, the lack of income is just a part of poverty, being the capability for agency the main skill to master one’s own life. Accordingly, the Capability income aims at detecting and removing the causes of poverty and their reproduction across generations through a combined intervention of welfare, welfare to work and learnfare, in which centrality is given to social inclusion alongside labour market activation and in which education, from the early childhood, vocational training and lifelong learning are promoted as an opportunity for empowerment and not only for employability. The paper addresses these questions and also discusses the implications of a political approach which recognizes that employment is not always sufficient to protect against poverty and which states that achievement of wealth and autonomy requires a merging of capabilities and rights; that is to say of individual responsibility and collective solidarity.",,Capability Income: A policy proposal in the fight against poverty and social exclusion

Policymakers fear intuitive, 'values'-based opposition from socially conservative voters, whom the policy would benefit materially, but who might regard it as 'giving others something for nothing'. We provide evidence from 'red wall' constituencies in Wales and the Midlands and North of England that indicates this presumption of voters is wrong. In Study 1, we find high levels of support for the policy, with different narrative framings more effective for different groups based on their material interests. In Study 2, we used a novel 'adversarial collaboration' method to show that simple narratives can strongly increase support for UBI even among respondents who initially see themselves as fundamentally opposed. The generated narratives stressed positive, material consequences of introducing UBI, rather than conformity with abstract values.

Basic income proposals have always had strong defenders and critics among feminists. Some feminists have argued that basic income will finally deliver the long-awaited recognition of unpaid work and caregiving, work that is primarily performed by women. Other feminists have worried that a basic income would function as hush money, discouraging women from striving for more far-reaching gender equality. Both views are prima facie plausible. Both views have also been defended in the growing body of gender analyses published in the last decades. The first published views by basic income advocates stated that basic income was a good thing for women: unpaid work would be socially recognised, women’s autonomy would be strengthened, women’s bargaining position within the household would improve, and men would be encouraged to share more in the",https://doi.org/10.2202/1932-0183.1137,Introduction: Revisiting the Feminism and Basic Income Debate
-16.68487,47.448982,3,"Abstract Degrowth has become a recognised paradigm for identifying and critiquing systemic unsustainability rooted in the capitalist, growth-compelled economy. Increasingly, degrowth is discussed in relation to specific economic sectors such as the agri-food system. This paper builds on the foundational work of Gerber (2020) and Nelson and Edwards (2021). While both publications take a rather specific analytical or disciplinary focus—the former specifically connects critical agrarian studies and degrowth, the latter explores the contributions of the recent volume ‘Food for degrowth’—this paper takes stock of the emerging body of literature on degrowth and agri-food systems more broadly. It proposes research avenues that deepen, expand and diversify degrowth research on agri-food systems in four areas: (i) degrowth conceptualisations; (ii) theorisation of transformations towards sustainability; (iii) the political economy of degrowth agri-food systems; and (iv) rurality and degrowth. Together, these avenues devote due attention to a variety of agents (ranging from translocal networks to non-humans), spaces (e.g. the rural), theories (e.g. sustainability transitions and transformations towards sustainability) and policies (of the agricultural sector and beyond) that thus far have received limited attention within the degrowth literature. The critical social science perspective on degrowth agri-food systems, which is advanced in this paper, illuminates that the present unsustainability and injustice of hegemonic agri-food systems are not merely a problem of that sector alone, but rather are ingrained in the social imaginaries of how economies and societies should work as well as in the political–economic structures that uphold and reproduce these imaginaries.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01276-y,Degrowth and agri-food systems: a research agenda for the critical social sciences

It states that the cost of providing everyone with a decent income floor, beneath which no one would fall, is out of reach for governments and public finance. Income taxes would have to be raised to unacceptable levels to accomplish this, the objection claims. This paper addresses the objection by demonstrating its weaknesses and showing that a universal basic income is affordable. It is in fact more affordable than the current wasteful array of often counter-productive, bureaucratic income security programs. Better results can be achieved with lower costs by implementing basic income, or a guaranteed livable income. This study does not seek any cuts to vital public programs such as universal health care or education to attain the result of a basic income sufficient to cover one's needs for food, modest shelter etc. at all times.

Now in most countries women and even the poor, who are over 18 years of age, have the vote – although there are still writers who advocate that those who receive more in benefits from the government than they pay in tax should lose the franchise (Hazlitt cited in Van Parijs 1996, p. 110). Modern citizenship is conceived of as embodying a more complex collection of features than the franchise or even broader political rights. After Marshall (1950), it now includes social and economic rights. These latter rights are outlined in United Nations conventions and find elaborate expression in the works of Basic Income advocates (Van Parijs 1992, 1997, Standing 2002, 2004, Murray 1997).

One view argues that the guaranteed income is an employer subsidy, facilitating low wages and a ‘low-road’ industrial strategy. The second view suggests that in providing an alternative to work, the guaranteed income tightens labor markets and pulls wages up.

This research focuses on Mincome’s ‘saturation’ site, the town of Dauphin, Manitoba, where all residents were eligible for unconditional payments. Using an archived survey of local firms that inquires into wage rates, applications, hiring, and work hours, I find support for the second view.

We rely on a natural experiment by analysing data from the Belgian National Elections Study that was collected both before and during the pandemic. The results indicate an increase in support for a BI due to the pandemic, although it seems short lived and not necessarily specific to a BI.

studies on the subject are reviewed in order to answer this question. One is the pilot study of
Unconditional Basic Income in rural India (conducted by SEWA and UNICEF in 2011-2013)
and the other is the Bolsa Escola/ Bolsa Familia program that was launched in Brazil in 1995
and is still ongoing. The aim is to map out different and similar components and results of the
two implementations of BI and to compare them to each other, and also to compare the results
to the theoretical and empirical expectations.

The questions that are answered by this paper are:
1. What were the results of the Indian and Brazilian BI studies, and were they similar to
the ones that could be expected from theoretical and empirical experience?
2. Are the results convincing enough to make future policy recommendations in favor of
Basic Income in other countries?

To examine these two studies a six-principle framework is used, covering different aspects,
which aim to determine the successfulness of a policy. Rawls Theory of Justice and classic
labor economic theories are used to analyze the results. The analysis shows that the
components that were present in both studies were the overall reduction on levels of poverty
(school participation rates, health and equality). This despite the Indian study being universal
to all within the test villages, and the Brazilian study being selective and conditional, which is
not in line with what could be expected from theory. As was expected from the labor supply
curve, there was a small drop in labor supply detected in both studies, even if the overall
productivity was perceived better in the Indian villages with the BI. In these two cases the
impact of a BI was successful, but since the two studies differ largely more research on what
role local factors play is relevant in order to make recommendations in other countries for
implementing BI policies.",,Basic Income: A Comparative Study of Brazil and India

The second appeals to the notion of reciprocity in order to justify the requirement that people work for their benefits. We cast doubt on both of these arguments for workfare.

The aim of this paper is to establish a relationship between the idea of an unconditional basic income and republican thought in general and the Swiss republican tradition in particular. I argue that Swiss republicanism bears a development potential that may provide a normative foundation for the introduction of an unconditional basic income.
Basic income can be justified on grounds of the conception of modern republicanism and its underlying ideal of freedom as non-domination. The Swiss republican tradition shows considerable affinity to this ideal of non-domination; its history can be read as a struggle against domination. In this sense, Swiss republicanism can be linked to the idea of an unconditional basic income. In contrast to other republican traditions in Europe, Swiss republicanism was able to develop and incorporate individualist values in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. Swiss republicanism still plays an important role in Swiss politics. The thesis that there still exists a relationship between Swiss republicanism and basic income will be corroborated by virtue of two examples: an old Swiss republican communal tradition that is still practised consists of disbursing an income that shows remarkable similarities to an unconditional basic income grant. Further, in contemporary Swiss social policy, the first pillar of the Swiss pension system bears considerable resemblance to the basic income idea. On the level of welfare regime research, one can even speak of a soft guarantism that prevails in Swiss social policy.
In Switzerland, a public discourse about the idea of an unconditional basic income has not yet developed. However, in order to inspire discourse, the link to Swiss republicanism could be emphasised. The pathway to the introduction of an unconditional basic income has begun in Swiss traditions already centuries ago. The prospect of further good development in the sense of freedom as nondomination in Switzerland should tie in with Switzerland's own past and tradition.",,Why Switzerland?

Nowadays added-up income and benefits plus social services by far exceed direct gross as well as, even more, net wages and salaries. Given all these provisions, an unconditional basic income for every citizen has become a popular issue. Switzerland has put it to a referendum on 5 th   June 2016.

The possible structure of a dynamic model is discussed by presenting different modules which might be useful as building blocks of a comprehensive model of the society. In this connection, different measures for accelerating the process to a society of solidarity are discussed. After defining the aims of a society of solidarity the following modules are presented: population model with educational model, structural model of time provided, extended input-output model including traditional and private production activities, linkages with economic-environmental models, income policy measures, transition model to labor values, and structural model of time directly or indirectly received by the population.Key words: Solidarity; dynamic modeling, extended input-output models; population and educational model; time provided and received environmental impacts; income policy and labor valuationIntroductionAiming at a society of solidarity, its main manifestations need to be spelled out. Implementing the principle of solidarity would mean in practice:* Solidarity between the recipients of income. Differences of net income should only reflect qualification requirements (educational achievement and experience) and risks associated with an occupation, such as impacts on physical and mental health.* Solidarity on the paid labor market. The disposable amount of paid labor should be shared among employable persons. This requirement implies that the average hours of paid work per person have to be substantially reduced and that all persons able to work should get free access to the necessary basic and advanced education.* Solidarity between men and women. Men and women should equitably share paid and unpaid work. In most societies, this aim implies that women's participation in the market for paid labor increases whereas that of men decreases. Concurrently, men would have to considerably notch up their share of hours spent on domestic tasks and caring for children, the ill, and the elderly. Of course, the principle of equal pay for equal work has to apply.* Solidarity between the generations. Children and elderly people should be supported by the middle-aged employed persons. Furthermore, to the extent feasible, young people should support the elderly just as the latter might take care of children and adolescents. Above and beyond fostering solidarity among current generations, caring for future generations requires us to pass on a sustainable society and (life-supporting) environment.* Solidarity between rich and poor countries. The above principles also apply beyond national borders and imply working towards fairly sharing economic, ecological, and social space and requisite resources among current generations both at the global and local level. Rich countries should support sustainable development of poor countries and should not continue to misuse them as a source of cheap labor and low-priced natural resources. Resources within poor countries need to be deployed with the aim of building solidary and resilient societies.* Solidarity between human beings and the natural environment. Instead of exploiting and destroying the natural environment, human beings should exercise stewardship for nature in all its facets by respecting and sustaining it and restoring it if damage has been inflicted.A solidary society can only evolve on the basis of viable and interconnected social units. It is not enough to call for social responsibility and feelings like empathy or compassion without creating concrete social networks for learning and practicing them. This exercise is only possible between people who know and trust each other through interacting in relatively small and manageable units. Therefore, the principle of subsidiarity seems to be an indispensable precondition for a society of solidarity. …",https://doi.org/10.2307/41931959,DYNAMIC MODELING TOWARDS A SOCIETY OF SOLIDARITY
-29.122578,1.7802219,2,"Abstract Proposals for a universal basic income have reemerged in public discourse for a variety of reasons. Marx’s critique of exploitation suggests two apparently opposed positions on a basic income. On the one hand, a basic income funded from taxes on labor would appear to be exploitative of workers. On the other hand, a basic income liberates everyone from the vulnerable condition in which one is forced to sell one’s labor in order to survive, and so seems to be one way of abolishing exploitation at its root. This paper will develop a conception of exploitation that resolves the conflict in favor of basic income. The conception of exploitation is grounded in a liberal egalitarian conception of justice rather than in Marx’s labor theory of value or an exclusive focus on the worker-capitalist relation. This position is not premised on an acceptance of the basic institutions of capitalism, but rather is a standpoint from which to evaluate them. It is not necessary to downsize our ideas of freedom and equality. But it is less obvious than it appeared in classic Marxist formulations that socialism is necessary for social justice.

Findings Even without any change in the current tax regulations, the TBI option, which requires a contribution of 2–3% disposable income from net contributors, will guarantee that no Australian family lives under the current national poverty line. The BI for all options is not financially feasible under the current tax and transfer regulations because it requires an additional tax rate of at least 42% of disposable income from net contributors.

An analysis of the literature shows that the “flexibilization” of the labor market is described in ambiguous terms: a number of authors describe the positive aspects (no set schedule, growth of individuality, eradication of bureaucratic restrictions), while others focus on the negative consequences (instability of income, lack of social guarantees, overexploitation, etc.). The author highlights a number of negative risks for the elderly gig-employed (forced self-employment, vulnerability to fraud, lack of social guarantees from the employer, etc.), but comes to the conclusion that the gig economy has a fairly positive impact on the employment of the elderly: 1) social security (basic pension income and social state protection), 2) integration into a new labor reality and opportunities to improve well-being, 3) resocialization, etc. A separate advantage of selfemployment is a fiscal innovation that is beneficial for the elderly which allows pensioners to obtain the status of self-employed without sacrificing pension indexation. The scientific novelty of the study lies in analyzing the employment of the older generation through the lens of the gig-economy and precarization.",https://doi.org/10.19181/socjour.2022.28.4.9317,Older Workers’ Labor and the Gig-Economy: Precarization or New Opportunities?

47.272495,-4.195864,4,"INTRODUCTIONMuhammad Yunus has spent a lifetime working to help the poor. He is the founding father of microfinance and has been compared to Mahatma Gandhi and Bill Gates. Decades before micro lending was popular among development economists, Yunus began making small, interest-free loans to poor rural women in Bangladesh. He believed that what keeps the poor poor isn't a lack of skill or education or work ethic, but merely access to financial intermediation. In 2006 Yunus and Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize for the success of this philosophy, and despite its criticisms and recent controversies microfinance remains a trusted method of bottom-up poverty alleviation.In recent years Dr. Yunus has moved beyond just lending to the poor; his new goal is to eliminate poverty entirely, and his method is to spread the practice of   business, a self-sustaining, zero-loss, zero-dividend   model that applies not only to microfinance but to any good or service provided to the poor. Eschewing traditional for-profit and non-profit models, Building Social Business explains how to create a self-sufficient   that serves humanity's most pressing needs.The book is written for the layperson and shows a gifted communicator at work, simultaneously informing, entertaining, and instructing. Chapters 3 and 5 offer a step -bystep game plan for a socially-minded entrepreneur to start his or her own   business. Build a   around something you're passionate about, Yunus encourages, but tackle an obtainable goal. Look at emulating successful projects in new markets, or find a way to apply your for-profit career skills to   business. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, Yunus encourages luring the most creative, determined workers with competitive salaries and benefits; if the financial rewards are no different, Yunus believes most people will take the job that works to solve   problems. The author also lays out the legal and financial framework for   businesses. Because they aren't recognized as a separate   category,     founders must choose between nonprofit status, which offers tax exemptions in most nations but is strictly regulated, or for-profit status. Yunus waits with eager determination for governments to organize new categories for   businesses.Though primarily a call to action, Building Social Business also advances a strong normative stance against profit and ascribes an overly narrow role to entrepreneurship in improving human conditions. As this review will show, neither argument rests on sound theoretical foundations, and supporting evidence for his arguments is sorely lacking. It will take many more years for   businesses to prove long-term success at solving   problems.Much of Building Social Business repeats the ideas in his 2008 book, Creating a World Without Poverty, which in turn expanded on his 2006 Nobel lecture. In this earlier book, Yunus defines a social business and describes what he sees as the first example of it, Grameen Danone, a joint venture between Grameen Bank and the French yogurt company Groupe Danone. What distinguishes Building Social Business is the step-bystep guideline for entrepreneurs to create their own   businesses, as well as its report on two more years of Grameen Bank's joint venture   businesses; five of the nine chapters, in fact, are descriptions of Grameen' s current and impending     partnerships.As described in the first chapter, a     is one whose goal is to solve a   problem - to alleviate poverty or malnutrition, deliver sanitary water to rural villages, or provide some other service (affordable clothing, education, electricity, healthcare) that would otherwise be unavailable. Essentially, a     seeks to correct a market failure - through private, philanthropic enterprise rather than government intervention. Unlike a nonprofit organization, though, a     should be self-sustaining, rather than reliant on donations. …",,Book Review: Building Social Business: The New Kind of Capitalism That Serves Humanity's Most Pressing Needs

In this paper, the notion is considered on the basis of the   of liberal egalitarianism, for which the anchor point is to be found in Rawls' philosophical works. Although this author certainly does not support basic income, he still provides an appropriate general framework to consider it, in particular through the hierarchy of his principles of justice (I). At the third level of this hierarchy, the interpretation of the principle of difference appeared controversial concerning the treatment of Malibu surfers, through which Van Parijs can have defended the unconditional nature of basic income (II). There remains the transition from the philosophy to the economics of basic income, which allows considering it as a precise alternative of negative income tax. At this stage, a rereading of Friedman's intuition on this topic results in seeing basic income as a universal tax credit (III). We conclude with some prospective remarks on a possible implementation of this conception of basic income in the case of liberal democracies and of France as well (IV).",,Liberal Foundations of Basic Income.

To prove this thesis, I first examine the process of robotization during past decades and especially during the past few years in order to illustrate the scale of the problem, which is on its earlier stage today, but is expected to change the economic and political reality of all societies in the years to come. After that, I examine two main views about the contradictions and conflicts that robotization brings. Firstly, attention is paid to the vision of techno-optimists, which corresponds mainly to the theories of neoliberalism and neoclassic. After that, the view of techno-pessimists is examined, related mainly to realistic and Marxist tradition in political economy. Several aspects of the contemporary discussion about the overcoming of the contradictions of robotization are addressed – mainly through reduced working hours, unconditional basic income and taxing robots instead of humans. The idea is that replacing people with robots will raise growing problems to all human societies, so steps must be taken to overcome the emerging contradictions. The important thing here is the need to address the education, innovativeness and the ability of the modern man for a fast reaction to the quickly changing economic and social environment.

Such a system is cheap and easy to administer as there is no means testing or checks on conditionality. There are a growing number of trials across the world and increasing support for such a scheme in the UK. A decade of austerity policies in the UK followed by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the views of some that UBI would not only address the issue of poverty and low-paid work but would serve as a response to growing automation in the workplace. It might also increase the bargaining power of workers who would be less worried about losing their job if they had the cushion of UBI.,https://doi.org/10.13169/jglobfaul.9.2.0225,Universal basic income: An idea whose time has come or just another mechanism to grease the wheels of capitalism?

This restriction is a drawback of these analyses and of the standard economic labor supply model itself. If one wants to understand the potential effects of basic income on individual and social welfare, one should not restrict observation to the pecuniary uses of time. The objective of this contribution is to rethink the meaning of work usually applied in economic models, based on contributions of other social scientists. This reassessment is undertaken through the development of a microeconomic model, which discusses the effects of basic income on time use and interprets work not just as a source of income, but also of non-pecuniary benefits.

The methodologyconsists of macro-micro simulation in which a CGE model provides labor market outcomes,which in turn are used to manipulate the sectoral allocation of employment to generate theincome distribution consistent with the new labor market outcome. In the application to Jamaica,we find that the reallocation of resources away from rent-seeking activities in the presence ofexchange controls is significant and has large macroeconomic effects.

The impact of 21st-century technological progress on employment has only just begun to make itself felt and it will take time to realize its full extent. However, the main innovation is already common knowledge: robots (and artificial intelligence) are finding their way into the production process. According to several recent (although controversial) contributions, the phenomenon is radically different from past technological revolutions and could generate high levels of unemployment, calling for innovative redistributive public policies. The present article, building on Keynes’ (1930) short essay (“Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren”) and referring to some of the principles and models of behavioral and happiness economics, focuses on the best-known of these policies, namely provision of an unconditional basic income. A series of factors – loss aversion and hedonic adaptation, the impossibility of escalating to higher-grade consumption behaviors, social interaction in the form of active and passive envy, loss of self-esteem and social stigma – are all likely to have a negative impact on well-being if an unconditional basic income that remains unchanging over time is implemented.

These latter rights are outlined in United Nations conventions and find elaborate expression in the works of Basic Income advocates (Van Parijs 1992, 1997, Standing 2002, 2004, Murray 1997). In Britain, the main Basic Income advocacy group calls itself “Citizens Income”. Yet in many parts of the world residues exist of an earlier conception of citizenship which are closely tied to notions of economic self sufficiency. In this paper we will contrast the ideologies which underlie the treatment of paupers and those which underpin Basic Income.",,From Paupers to Citizenship

Taking into account such features, as the new situation generated by the emergence of cognitive capitalism forces us to do, requires a major change in paradigm. In the new “bio-economic” paradigm, classical distinctions between production and reproduction, consumption and production, leisure and work tend to vanish, while labor increasingly appears as a common good.

Yet, the organisation of social protection within the European Union (EU) is insufficient to protect all Europeans effectively against the risk of poverty and social exclusion. Against this backdrop, this thesis investigates whether a European universal basic income (EUBI) is, if at all, a worthwhile policy to address the problem of poverty in the EU. 

The central claim of the study posits that there are strong reasons to consider a partial EUBI as a desirable instrument for EU-wide poverty alleviation. Under this scenario, the EU works as a complementary welfare layer offering systemic support to its Member States’ welfare models whilst respecting the diversity of national social protection arrangements. At the same time, as an instrument of pan-European solidarity, the EUBI provides substance to EU social citizenship. 

The method used is problem-oriented and interdisciplinary, combining insights from political theory, political economy and EU studies writ large. After having layed out the various dimensions underpinning the problem of poverty in the EU and clarified the contours of the solution under scrutiny, the thesis confronts the EUBI with a series of challenges, ranging from normative issues associated with the unconditionality of the basic income and the pursuit of social justice in the EU, to the institutional hurdles pertaining to the legal feasibility of the proposal, via the macroeconomic difficulties related to the diversity of interdependent economies. 

Overall, this contribution examines an idea which remains unexplored in EU studies and proposes a new approach to European anti-poverty strategy. It also bridges the gap between EU social policy and basic income literatures, beyond established boundaries of research compartmentalisation. As such, it prepares the ground for further fine-tuned research in the areas covered by this comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis.",,Fighting poverty in the European Union: an assessment of the prospects for a European universal basic income (EUBI)

-10.331249,-2.6959677,0,"This paper aims to propose a social protection system that decommodifies labour and fulfills the properties of a Social Protection Floor satisfying revenue-neutrality. To this end, firstly, a Universal Basic Income (UBI) scheme is explored. Secondly, the UBI is transformed into a Negative Income Tax (NIT) scheme, providing universal protection instead of universal benefits. Finally, the NIT is modified into a Hybrid NIT (HNIT), being a mixture of NIT and a classic social assistance scheme. It features a 100% withdrawal rate, consequently allowing for a higher guaranteed minimum income level than would be possible with either an NIT or UBI. A static microsimulation, using the EUROMOD model, is conducted on the HNIT scheme, implementing two scenarios. One scenario establishes what the maximum levels of entitlements could be, assuming revenue-neutrality and current marginal tax levels. The other scenario assumes more generous entitlements and computes which tax rates would be necessary to pay for such a scheme. The models are applied to both Italy and the United Kingdom. The results are interpreted in terms of poverty and inequality statistics while closely looking into the assumptions of the microsimulation models. In the first scenario a modest level of guaranteed minimum income is feasible, decreasing both poverty and inequality decidedly compared to current levels. This effect is even stronger in the second scenario, however, it results in unrealistically high tax rates, especially for Italy. The impact on poverty and inequality of the HNIT scheme is markedly higher for Italy in both scenarios suggesting that the United Kingdom has currently a social protection system in place that redistributes more efficiently than Italy.",,The effects of a hybrid negative income tax on poverty and inequality: A microsimulation on the UK and Italy

Much of recent social expenditure reform had an ad-hoc nature and was driven by the need to alleviate looming financial, distress.

In this sense, its right to affirm that such objectives guide the national legal system in its entirety. The power of taxation, attributed to the State by the People, owner of the sovereignty, does not include the power of depriving such People of the minimum necessary to the maintenance of a dignifying existence. The taxes, which are the States source of income, may not be limited to the enrichment of the State Treasuries, for sometimes it can, simultaneously, fill extra taxation purposes. Especially regarding the discipline reserved to the Tax on Industrialized Products IPI, the Constitution legislator was extremely prudent on providing mechanisms, in the form of principles, capable of providing its use not only for income purposes, but also as an instrument of high social value. All of this because the State may not be alienated to the problems related to Societys biggest needs. Among such mechanisms, the Constitutional principles of equalness and contributive capability are to be highlighted, just as other related principles, mainly the Principle of Selectivity. The existence of a fair tax system presupposes that the State treats equally all taxpayers that fit into an identical situation, promoting income distribution and economic development. The non fulfillment of the Social Goal of the IPI presents, as a consequence, the possibility of grave social dysfunction, that is, the taxation of the IPI, not attached to the correct observance of the aforementioned Principle of Selectivity may entail the inhibition of production of the private sector and of the national economy, with all the problems it will bring.

Certain social welfare policies such as caretakers’ allowances can be interpreted as initiatives that aim to compensate the undervalued and non-income generating care work predominantly done by women. The article assesses such policies in the framework of feminist debates on gender, care and welfare and argues that as long as such policies assume that caring is women’s natural job, they will fall short of serving gender equality.

In 2020, the idea of unconditional cash payments gained a significant number of new supporters. This was partly due to the vibrant political campaign of Andrew Yang, who took part in U.S. Democratic primaries, advocating the introduction of the so-called freedom dividend for all Americans, regardless of their income level or labor status. However, a real surge in interest occurred against the backdrop of a global recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced national governments to respond quickly to new social and economic challenges. In a number of East Asian countries, the authorities provided a one-time emergency assistance to the entire population. Compared to other types of direct payments (“helicopter money”), emergency basic income has shown several advantages. Due to its universal nature, it covers all citizens, including those who are completely or partially excluded from existing social protection systems. Moreover, in organizational terms, it is much easier to directly transfer an equal sum of money to everyone, especially in conditions of self-isolation. In Western countries, however, the probability of transition to basic income, even in its emergency form, is still rather low.

Seldom have trials of UBI been designed adequately to measure its impact on the health of participants across the spectrum of socioeconomic status. But the data that does exist suggests that policy has the potential to improve this aspect of people’s lives. Two theoretical frames have been advanced to explain this effect. The first is based, broadly, on its impact on behaviour, highlighting the ways in which present socio-economic conditions, including needs and means-based welfare systems, disincentivise healthy choices and activity. The second is based, broadly, on its impact on the endocrine system, holding that UBI serves to protect individuals from a range of stress-related illnesses induced by socio-economic conditions associated with hierarchy and inequality. While the absence of epidemiological input into designing trials means that these frames have yet to be tested, there are good sources of data from non-UBI-related studies that support their validity. This account lays out pathways to impact, demonstrates important points of consideration in the designing of trials and argues strongly for a trial on the basis of a transformative ‘upstream intervention’ capable of shaping the way that we deal with health.

In addition to this implicit role of a structural form of solidarity that can connect various communities and constituencies together into a powerful political bloc, Caroline West also articulates an important role for highly local forms of community and solidarity in this region's transformation.

-12.858721,12.892196,2,"This paper argues that a guaranteed income is not only consistent with the principle of reciprocity but is required for reciprocity. This conclusion follows from a three-part argument. First, if a guaranteed income is in place, all individuals have the same opportunity to live without working. Therefore, those who choose not to work do not take advantage of a privilege that is unavailable to everyone else. Second, in the absence of an unconditional income, society is, in effect, applying the principle He who does not work, will not eat. If the application of this principle is to be consistent with reciprocity, it must be applied to everyone. Most modern industrial societies exempt many citizens from that choice. For example, the owners of external assets do not face the work-or-starve choice and do take advantage of a privilege that is not available to others. An unconditional guaranteed income is one way to eliminate that violation of reciprocity. Third, this paper addresses the criticism that the guaranteed income exploits middle-class workers by demonstrating that a basic income will have a positive effect on wages, which will at least partially counteract the effect of the taxes needed to pay for it.",,Reciprocity and the Guaranteed Income

This development in labor markets would put pressure on the sort of labor subsidies we already have in the U.S., but would not necessarily demand a new sort of arrangement to provide for basic needs (e.g., universal basic income). A more robust Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC would offer a more targeted solution. The Living Wage EITC contemplated here would be a long-term, ongoing subsidy for a sort of job that may become more common: somewhat low paying and with no prospects for advancement.

This earlier comprehensive retrenchment programme by National transformed the welfare state from one based on the notion that the state would provide for people in need, to a residual welfare state in which people were supposed to seek support from the state only as a last resort. Family income policy was targeted to a narrower group of recipients, the conditions for benefit eligibility were tightened, benefit payments reduced and a discourse of welfare dependency that stigmatised benefit recipients was promoted. From 2008, this article argues National's measures were merely incremental adjustments to its previous policy direction and which served to further embed the paradigm shift it had introduced in the 1990s.

Since the First World War, a variety of market economists, radical activists, and social reformers have emphasized the possibility of tackling poverty through direct cash transfers between the state and its citizens. As manufacturing employment has declined and wage inequality has grown since the 1970s, cash benefits and tax credits have become a major income source for millions of working-age households, including many low-paid workers with children. The nature and purpose of these transfer payments, however, remain highly contested. Conservative and New Labour governments have used in-work benefits and conditionality requirements to ‘activate’ the unemployed and reinforce the incentives to take low-paid work—an approach which has reached its apogee in Universal Credit.

Thus we find that employment-stimulating policies in t – 1 increase labour supply in t by shifting the composition of the labour force in t in favour of employment categories and away from unemployment categories. We illustrate this idea by using MONASH to simulate the Dawkins proposal to combine a freeze on award wage rates with tax credits for low-wage workers in low-income families. We find that the Dawkins policy would generate a significant short-run increase in employment. With the increase in employment generating an increase in labour supply, the employment benefits of the policy would persist over many years. However, in the long run, we would expect the effect of the policy on aggregate employment to be small and to depend on how the policy affected the ratio of real after-tax wage rates to unemployment benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8462.00265,A New Specification of Labour Supply in the MONASH Model with an Illustrative Application

Poverty, income inequality and unemployment are expected to rise all around the world due to the pandemic corona virus outbreak and the subsequent economic crisis. Governments around the world have already implemented measures similar to universal basic income with the purpose of increasing household consumption and stimulating aggregate demand but also to mitigate the devastating effects that the recent unfavorable economic developments have on the citizens living in poverty or are at the risk of poverty. However, shrinking fiscal spaces of small economies could be an obstacle to implement such policies. Compared to universal basic income, negative income tax is a less costly policy option that targets the population living in poverty instead of providing payments to everyone regardless of their income. The analysis based on the available data is indicating that implementing such policy would cost as much as 9.7 billion MKD per year, which is 4% of the planned state budget revenues for Y2020, 8% of the planned social transfers for Y2020 and 29% of the funds that the state has made available for tackling the COVID 19 crisis so far. In addition, the negative income tax could trigger various positive effects on the economy. Since poor people spend almost all of their income, it could be expected that implementing negative income tax would rise household consumption. According to the empirical analysis in this paper, household consumption is in highest correlation to GDP growth in Macedonia compared to the other explanatory variables (government consumption, investments, import and export).",https://doi.org/10.47063/ebtsf.2020.0002,THE COST OF NEGATIVE INCOME TAX AS A FISCAL MEASURE TO TACKLE POVERTY IN NORTH MACEDONIA

The expenses of the redistribution pertaining to basic goods, as well as those associated with public (non-basic) but vital goods, are separately estimated by transforming the expenses into functions of the poverty line. The findings reveal that, along the poverty line that treats all citizens equally, the politicians representing opposing ideologies decide how the redistribution of basic and vital goods should be financed. Politicians should come to an agreement, subject to an approval of their decisions by voters-citizens. However, in the absence of such approval, politicians have no alternative but to continue the negotiations. Based on this premise, we concluded that political decisions with an elevated poverty line, as a parameter, would give rise to inverse working incentives of benefits claimants.

Basic income—a no-strings-attached cash transfer made to all citizens of a country, rich or poor—has been lauded as a plan to eliminate poverty, reduce income inequality, redress imbalances in the labor market, remedy the impending problem of mass technology-induced unemployment—the “robot apocalypse”—and make possible meaningful lives for those otherwise dependent on menial work in the labor market. It has also been proposed as an efficient, nonpaternalistic, and stigma-free alternative to existing welfare state policies. This Article compares basic income to an alternative policy proposal: the regulation of maximum working hours in the labor market. This Article contends that on nearly all of these virtues, working-time regulation does better than, or at least as well as, basic income. In particular, working-time regulation makes “free time” available to a broader array of individuals, also addresses technological unemployment, and is much more conducive to pro-environmental policies. Most importantly, it is more deeply egalitarian than basic income, not only addressing income inequality but social inequality, as well. Although basic income and working-time regulation are not necessarily incompatible—indeed some have advocated the adoption of both policies—there may be other factors that effectively render them policy substitutes. Specifically, not only is working-time regulation more complementary to existing welfare-state policy than is basic income, but—already in existence in the U.S. and most other developed countries—it also does not face the challenges of political and economic feasibility that confront basic income.

Although even the most optimistic advocates for a UBI will acknowledge that nationwide implementation lies years away, the design of a basic income will require sustained scholarly attention. This article seeks to advance the conversation among academics and policymakers about UBI implementation. 

Our prior work has focused on the philosophical foundations of a basic income; here, we build up from those foundations to identify the practical building blocks of a large-scale cash transfer program. After canvassing the considerations relevant to the design of a UBI, we arrive at a set of specific recommendations for policymakers. We propose a UBI of $6000 per person per year, paid to all citizens and lawful permanent residents via direct deposit in biweekly installments. We argue — contrary to other UBI proponents — that children and seniors should be included, that adjustments for household size and cost of living should be rejected, that recipients should have a limited ability to use future payments as collateral for short- and medium-term loans, and that the Social Security Administration should carry out the program. We also explain how a UBI could be financed through the consolidation of existing cash and near-cash transfer programs as well as the imposition of a relatively modest surtax on all earners.

Importantly, the building blocks of a UBI do not necessarily determine its outward face. By this, we mean that economically identical programs can be described in very different ways — e.g., as a UBI with no phaseout, a UBI that phases out with income, and a “negative income tax” — without altering any of the essential features. To be sure, packaging matters to the public perception of a UBI, and we consider reasons why some characterizations of the program may prove more popular than others. Our article seeks to sort the building blocks of a UBI out from the cosmetic components, thereby clarifying which elements of a UBI shape implementation and which ones affect only the outward appearance.",,The Architecture of a Basic Income

Evidence on India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act does not suggest that the potential for either providing work when needed or reducing current poverty is being realized, despite pro-poor targeting. Instead, work is often rationed by local leaders in poor areas, and the poverty impact is small when all the costs are considered. Decentralized implementation of the right-to-work poses serious challenges in poor places. The option of income support using cash transfers also has both pros and cons. Widely-used methods for finely targeting cash transfers tend to miss many poor people, and discourage those reached from earning extra income. Yet it cannot be presumed that switching to a universal basic income will reduce poverty more than workfare or finely-targeted transfers; that is an empirical question and the answer will undoubtedly vary across settings, belying the generalizations often heard from advocates. Nonetheless, more incentive-neutral, universal and/or state-contingent transfer schemes merit consideration in settings in which existing public spending is skewed against poor people and/or there is scope for raising taxes on the rich.",,Guaranteed Employment or Guaranteed Income

After studying the macroeconomic viability of each program, the paper elaborates on their environmental merits. It is argued that the “green” consequences of the basic income proposal are likely to emerge, not from its modus operandi, but from the tax schemes that have been advanced for its financing.

We focus on a proposal by the European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) for an EU Framework Directive on Minimum Income Protection, in order to examine three aspects of that policy conundrum: (1) the instrumental relevance of minimum income protection; (2) the unequal burden of the redistributive effort that would be required across the EU if the Union were to impose hic et nunc a minimum income guarantee of 60% or 40% of the median national income in all Member States; and (3) the impact on dependency traps, under the same hypothesis. We illustrate each of these observations empirically, using cross-nationally comparable data on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) and minimum income protection levels (CSB-MIPI). Since a harmonised minimum income scheme requires a significantly greater budgetary effort on behalf of some of the poorer Member States in Eastern and Southern Europe, it raises a complex question about the meaning of solidarity within the EU. Enhanced solidarity within Member States cannot be decoupled from enhanced solidarity among Member States Â– and vice versa. Simultaneously, the EU should put positive pressure on poorer and richer Member States to gradually improve the overall quality and efficiency of their welfare regimes.

This idea has generated wide interest in a number of countries, and is being actively discussed by several political parties.

At the same time, it also raises the question of whether a single reform can meet the very different objectives of different supporters. The author reviews different areas of public economics in which there has been active research in recent years-- namely the theory of optimum taxation, public choice theory, general equilibrium analysis of incidence, numerical tax- benefit modelling, and econometric studies of work incentives--and asks how these contribute to our understanding of this particular policy reform.

3.8182085,-0.61051834,4,"Cash transfer programmes are widely considered a ‘magic bullet’ for reducing poverty. Whether they actually have such an incredible impact on poverty reduction is debatable but they surely are gaining credibility as an effective safety net mechanism and consequently an integral part of inclusive growth strategies in many developing countries. As shown by Ali (2007), inclusive growth rests on three basic premises. First, productive employment opportunities should be created to absorb labour force. Second, capability enhancement and skill development should be focused in order to broaden people’s access to economic opportunities. And lastly, a basic level of well-being has to be guaranteed by providing social protection. Safety nets are at the core of the last pillar, provided mainly through cash transfers, which can be both conditional and unconditional. The basic rationale behind the social safety nets is to assist the poor to better manage risk and help them to adopt a strategy that protects their assets. The importance of these safety nets has been recognised not only for their social and economic value but also as a means to improve political stability and control crime and riots. These safety nets help people through short-term stress and insecurities, which if properly managed can lead to long-term poverty alleviation as well. Direct transfers by the government are a common means of providing safety net to the poor. Such transfers include direct provision of food or cash (conditional or unconditional) to the target population. Other means of providing safety nets include: education and health subsidies; energy, water and housing subsidies; and public works programmes. It is worth mentioning here that, although usually used interchangeably, there is a need to differentiate between the term social protection and social safety nets [Bari, et al. (2005); Sayeed (2004)].

We believe that a globalised world, structured around the asymmetry between an increasingly small number of employers and an increasing, almost unlimited, supply of always available employees, leads to increasing inequalities. Under our perspective, in the post-industrialised economies of all major developed countries, paid work cannot be seen anymore as an instrument of self-determination (Marx, 1844) but becomes the main generator of exploitation and poverty. For this reason, we try to develop a benefit with attached strong disincentives to paid work that should provide people with an exit strategy and higher bargaining power. After presenting the main typologies of income benefits that are normally in use or discussed we provide a theoretical explanation of the Universal Independence Income (UII) benefit we want to introduce. We simulate the introduction of our preferred version of UII, two variations of UII and five forms of Universal Basic Income (UBI) to be compared with the tax and benefit system currently in place in the UK.

It is a type of minimum income guarantee that differs from those that now exist in various European countries. Considered in its pure form, a basic in-come is paid (1) to individuals rather than households; (2) irrespective of wealth or any in-come from other sources; and (3) without requiring the performance of any work or the will-ingness to accept a job if offered. Its relevance to the problems of contemporary welfare states has long been recognized. From the 1970s onwards, forms of basic income have been regu-larly proposed for adapting the post-war institutions of social transfer to the conditions of a modern economy, in which lifetime security through earned income is no longer the norm. The guiding claim was that an unconditional floor of guaranteed income is justified as the fairest and the most efficient way of reconstructing basic security in the welfare state. Inevita-bly, the fairness part of this claim led to a principled debate concerning the unconditional features of basic income, in particular the absence of the requirement of willingness to work. The reason for this is obvious, for any moral justification of unconditional basic income has to deal with the objection that it is unfair to hand out transfers to able-bodied persons who are merely unwilling to earn a living. This theme has been explored in depth in Arguing for Basic Income (1992). This book is divided in two distinct but interrelated parts, both of which reflect the main topics of the 1998 Congress of the Basic Income European Network.

Less clear, however, are the factors influencing support for a UBI. Using the 2016 European Social Survey, we investigate how trade union membership and left political ideology (central to power resources theory) and attitudes towards immigrants’ access to welfare benefits (central to welfare state chauvinism) affect individual support for a UBI. We also investigate how country-level differences in levels of social spending moderate individual-level UBI support. Results from multi-level models suggest that a broader coalition of UBI supporters can generally be found in countries where social spending is low. Specifically, we find that welfare state chauvinism is more likely to be associated with negative attitudes towards a UBI in countries with high levels of spending, but has only a weak association with UBI support in low-spending countries. Similarly, political ideology is more consequential in explaining UBI support in countries with higher levels of spending. These tensions form a demand–capacity paradox: the countries which are presumably least equipped to implement a UBI see the most broad-based support for the policy.",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/fvh92,Support for a Universal Basic Income: A Demand-Capacity Paradox?

Those opposed contend that it may compromise Canada's current state because it can be a disincentive to work, can be expensive, and may not target those worse off.

This paper provides a very inexpensive evaluation of such a policy by studying its dynamic consequences in a general equilibrium model with imperfect capital markets and labor market shocks, in which households make decisions about education, savings, labor supply, and with intergenerational linkages via skill formation. The steady state of the model is estimated to match US household data. We find that a UBI policy that gives all households a yearly income equivalent to the poverty line level has very different welfare implications for those alive when the policy is introduced relative to future generations. While a majority of adults (primarily older non-college workers) would vote in favor of introducing UBI, all future generations (operating behind the veil of ignorance) would prefer to live in an economy without UBI. The expense of the latter leads to lower skill formation and education, requiring even higher tax rates over time. Modeling automation as an increased probability of being hit by an ``out-of-work'' shock, the model is also used to provide insights on how the benefits of UBI change as the environment becomes riskier. The results suggest that UBI may be a useful transitional policy to help current individuals whose skills are more likely to become obsolete and are unprepared for the increased risk, while, simultaneously, education policies may be implemented to increase the likelihood that future cohorts remain productive and employed.",,Universal Basic Income: A Dynamic Assessment

Over time, however, income falls and poverty and inequality increase as fewer people stay in school, labor supply decreases, and savings fall. We then explore the consequences of an equivalent transfer that is both subject to means testing and requires recipients to enroll their children in school. This policy outperforms the UBI in several dimensions, increasing overall income, reducing poverty and inequality, and improving welfare. This result is robust to varying the magnitude of the cash transfer.

As Jacques Ranciere mentions, this is a condition of the current “post-political” time. In this context, UBI has appeared as a means to regain the political signification of individual attending to their material necessities and looking forward to avoiding an increasing level of precarity. However, UBI poses some processual and intrinsic problematizations affecting its emancipatory character resulting in exclusionary social, economic and political attitudes. Thus, this article will analyze the role of UBI in recovering the categories of citizen and democracy and the main problems its implementation would face. This research wants to show that, paradoxically, UBI can provide a substantial improvement for those social groups in risk of exclusion such as immigrants, women or precarious workers.

(Findings) As a result of comparing the importance among pensioners, public pensioners generally have a high distribution of importance to financial factors. On the other hand, national pensioners share the importance of each factor in various ways. The importance of all groups also emphasizes financial factors overall, but it is analyzed that strategies for pension policy, which is a political and social factor, and extension of retirement age by pension guarantee, which is a social and institutional factor, are also important.

The growing wealth inequality, the precarization of work, as well as the threat of technological unemployment — all these issues have caused a new wave of interest in universal approaches to the development of social systems. This wave reached its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic, which required emergency measures to support the economy and employment. In a number of countries, the idea of a complete or partial transition from traditional social protection schemes to equal payments for all has gained wide public support and was included in the programs of influential political parties. Many new experiments have been planned or are already under way to assess the UBI’s potential positive and negative effects. The major stumbling block, however, is the problem of funding. Analyzing the proposals put forward in the academic, expert and political communities, the author of the article comes to the conclusion that the transition to a full-fledged UBI even in the most developed countries will be associated with an unacceptable increase in the budget deficit and government debt. A more realistic scenario is the gradual incorporation of certain elements of basic income into existing social systems. Possible approaches here are: the provision of modest benefits, significantly below the national poverty line; payments in favor of particularly vulnerable population groups; implementation of UBI as an emergency measure for a limited period of time.",https://doi.org/10.33920/vne-04-2112-02,Basic Income in the Pandemic Era: Another False Start or a New Paradigm of Social Policy?
10.136881,-14.228142,0,"Schemes to replace traditional welfare programmes with a universal basic income (UBI) are sometimes presented as a way to reduce overall economic inequality. But because they lower the implicit marginal taxation rate of individuals entering the workforce, they have the effect of increasing economic inequality between those who opt out of the workforce and those who choose to participate. This article examines the effect that an increase in this income gap can be expected to have on the perceived adequacy of the UBI payment level as an alternative to paid employment. The first question involves the extent to which individuals living on UBI payments will assess the adequacy of their condition by comparing themselves to those who are adjacent to them in the income distribution. If this looms large in their assessment, then the UBI, by increasing inequality within this segment of the income distribution, will tend to increase the perception of its own inadequacy. The second question involves the importance of the consumption of positional goods in determining the adequacy of the UBI. If these are significant then again this will increase the perception of inadequacy, because those in paid employment will enjoy a great deal more than those who opt out.",https://doi.org/10.1111/japp.12569,Why a UBI Will Never Be High Enough

-22.960476,-19.5223,2,"This paper examines the role of basic income in constructing a dynamic, diverse and democratic social economy. ‘Basic income’ or BI is shorthand for a regular, sufficient and unconditional income, administered by the state and issued to every member of society. BI replaces social welfare payments, child benefit and the state pension as we currently know them. It also extends to all those who currently receive no income from the state. Ideally, a BI would be sufficient for each person to have a frugal but decent lifestyle without supplementary income from paid work.
Basic income is a measure that could be implemented during the current crisis in Ireland. It is a step that is possible within the tax and money regime that prevails at the moment, even in the EU‐ECB‐IMF troika programme. By itself, it will not achieve all that we need, but it has a crucial role to play in the transition to an economy and society based on the well being of all and the sharing of resources for the prosperity of all.
The paper begins by calling for ecological and economic literacy, so that the concept of basic income can be understood in a wider framework of knowledge about:
• managing the resources of the world (the commons) for the benefit of all members of society
• basic securities as a pre‐requisite for sustainability and resilience
• work in its broadest sense, as any engagement with the world – paid or unpaid ‐‐ designed to change something or to add value to society or economy
• the wealth inherent in sufficiency.
The paper then examines the immediate benefits of basic income and the longer‐term possibilities for all kinds of work and workers. It also examines how basic income can support pioneers and seed projects that are already working towards a transformed economic and social regime characterised by greater equality, economic resilience and social solidarity.
The paper treats basic income as an essential and do‐able step in such a transformation. As a stand‐alone measure it would have beneficial effects. But it would have maximum effects if accompanied by democratic reform in tax and money systems.",,Cultivating resilient and ethical prosperity with basic income

Education has long been reckoned as such a social activity, and most of the effort required to supply the essential needs comprised in the idea of the social minimum and embodied in what has been described as a new Bill of Rights for the citizen might be placed in the same category. Mr. Geoffrey Crowther, editor of the Economist, in an article in the American periodical Fortune, goes so far as to suggest that all activities connected with the supply of the nation's food, including production, as agriculture, and distribution and processing, should be planned and controlled by the nation in order that the new standards of nutrition, etc., may be secured. The magnitude of the problem suggests at once that it is by no means easy to draw a line beyond which the profit motive should not be permitted.

Part II asks whether a UBI may nevertheless be a practical necessary soon, whether due to automation or the obsolescence of classic welfare state policies. Regarding technology, I argue that there is simply no evidence that a historically unprecedented automation wave is underway, or on the horizon. Regarding the welfare state, I argue that growing inequality and precarity today are not an inevitable result of the decline in manufacturing, but rather an effect of policy choices, especially choices to disempower labor.

We build a model to explore the potential of a universal basic income (UBI) to serve these objectives. Starting from the observation that post-growth trajectories can take very different forms we analyze UBI in two scenarios advanced in the literature. Comparing UBI in a “local self-sufficiency” economy to a UBI in an “automation” economy, we show that although both scenarios satisfy central sustainability criteria, the impact of a UBI would differ greatly between these contexts. Our analysis shows that a UBI is less compatible with a labor-intensive local self-sufficiency economy than a capital-intensive, high tech economy. We conclude that the feasibility and attractiveness of a UBI in a post-growth scenario depends greatly on the specific characteristics of the economy.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2019-0029,Basic Income and Social Sustainability in Post-Growth Economies

There are several types of libertarianism. In the genealogy of Nozick, self-ownership and the Lockean proviso are two cogs and wheels of such arguments. Libertarianism can take shape only as other argument supports the other. From this point of view, this paper examines in detail how Nozick has tried to defend self-ownership. His argument respects the separateness of persons in a certain way and attaches the importance to make it possible for people to freely design their own lives and live a meaningful life by themselves. In addition, after reviewing the nature of historical entitlement theory and the Lockean proviso, I will take up the interpretation of the Lockean proviso, which is a central theme in recent libertarianism. In this paper, I mainly consider the baseline of Nozick, sufficientarian interpretation and egalitarian interpretation. There are advantages to such a sufficientarian interpretation, derived not only from the adequacy of the theory as a distributive principle itself but also from the fact that (Nozickian) libertarianism bears a specific image (a person with self-ownership). Furthermore, this sufficientarian understanding provides a moral basis for free economic activity on markets, which libertarians regard as important, and it is different from divesting legitimate private property and redistributing it that libertarians reject. I define a simple and general basic income for theoritical purposes and for Japan. This paper ultimately concludes that basic income does not completely morally conform to the conception of sufficientarian libertarianism, despite its appeal, and I will defend a system such as guaranteed minimum income, though some difficult issues remain.JEL Codes: H21, H24, N35, P17",https://doi.org/10.3917/rpec.201.0035,Sufficientarian-Libertarianism and Basic Income

Weeks, Mason, Srnicek and Williams and others suggest that such a re-orientation of welfare distribution would not only mitigate the effects of these tectonic changes to the nature of labour, but it might in fact facilitate a break away from neoliberal capitalism and towards a post-work condition. Building upon the work of Universal Basic Income detractors such as Pitts and Dinerstein, this article brings into question the likelihood of these claims. Universal Basic Income’s advocates speak of the freedom to be unlocked by Universal Basic Income: but the freedom to do what and for whom? The article addresses the increasing significance for the process of valorisation today of digital ‘free labour’, and thus explores the idea that Universal Basic Income might have presented itself at this current juncture less to be a vehicle to a utopian future and more to be a handmaid for capitalism as its mode of production evolves. After utilising Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror to depict a dystopian imaginary of what a Universal Basic Income-future might thus really look like, the article concludes by questioning how we might rescue the scheme as a leftist project: attending to Guattari’s insights into how to resist capitalism’s subjectivation, as well as Fuchs’ vision for an ‘alternative Internet’.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0309816819852748,Universal basic income and cognitive capitalism: A post-work dystopia in the making?

While debated by academics and experimented with in several countries, it has not carried much weight in US public opinion until recently. Andrew Yang's support for it in his run for the 2020 Democrat nomiation for US President and the recently completed “Stockton Experiment” has garnered more press attention. Objective Examine support for a guaranteed annual income (GAI) in relation to attitudes regarding the role of work as an individual and social value. Methods A representative sample of United States adults were surveyed about their attitudes toward work, their view of government and support for GAI. Results A solid majority support GAI. This support comes in the face of a rather strong endorsement of the work ethic. Far from seeing the GAI as a disincentive to work, respondents indicate, on the whole, that they would not reduce their work hours if they received a GAI. Conclusion Data were collected during a pandemic that disrupted daily life. Thus, people may be ready to re‐examine some basic assumptions about the roles that state and market should play in society as well as re‐examine just what they are willing to define as “fair” and “just” in terms of economic responsibilities and rewards.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13086,Value orientations and support for guaranteed income

Their judgement may be affected by factors such as their work ethic, perceptions of the unemployed and preferences for labour decommodification. Yet, most studies fail to sketch out the reasons for which unions oppose or support a UBI from a normative standpoint. To understand the impact of ideology on unions’ appreciation for a UBI, I integrate results from 62 questionnaires with 27 in-depth qualitative interviews. This study illustrates that unions’ preferences for a UBI are associated with their theoretical understanding of labour, diverging substantially across welfare regimes. Whereas unions from Bismarckian and Nordic countries are generally opposed to a UBI, organizations from Liberal and Mediterranean countries tend to see UBI as a legitimate policy option.

-0.4244487,23.783148,2,"This article reviews the possible role of the universal basic income in the transformation of experience in gender and age perspectives. The universal basic income has been particularly hotly debated in recent decades. Regardless of the position, the common tone of the debates is the imperative “we must experiment.” Such a close interest in the universal basic income derives from the fact that it threatens to change the “generic” for humans situation of finiteness of resources and the need to work. Thus, it is able to change the experience of what it means to be human. Since the universal basic income allows to separate labor from income, it is likely that its introduction will return value to the currently stigmatized or devalued types of labor, such as child care, elderly care or domestic work. It creates opportunities for experience redistribution in gender perspective: care and leaving (career break), affective connection, and sensitivity could become the business of both parents, not just mothers. Another experience redistribution is possible in age perspective. Along with automation of labor, population ageing is a universal process that will sooner or later affect all the countries. Alarmist narratives that present this process as a threat and a problem now prevail. They are largely based on outdated ideas about old age and what it means to be old. However, in fact, ageing is the maturation of the population as a whole. With a proper re-evaluation of the meaning and significance of old age, the introduction of the universal basic income could create material conditions for the transfer of experience from the elderly to the younger – for the first time since traditional societies.",https://doi.org/10.30727/0235-1188-2020-63-3-131-141,Universal Basic Income as a Way of Redistribution of Experience between Individuals and Groups

While several studies shed new light on the individual characteristics associated with higher or lower support for a UBI, we still do not know what features of a UBI itself are attractive or not to people, nor whether other slightly different policy alternatives like means-tested and minimum incomes would be more popular. This article addresses this gap by employing a conjoint experiment fielded in Finland, where a UBI has received significant media and political attention. Our findings show that the most contentious dimension of a UBI is – surprisingly – not its universality, but instead its unconditional nature. Individuals are more likely to support policies that condition receipts upon searching for employment or being genuinely unable to work, and less likely to support policies that are fully unconditional. On the funding side, support tends to be lower for a UBI that is linked to reducing existing benefits, but higher if the UBI is to be funded by increasing taxes, especially on the rich. These findings contribute to a wider literature on the politics of UBI and to our understanding of the potential popularity of competing policy reform alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1177/09589287211072638,"What’s not to like?

The article points out that, during the last three years in Russia, the idea of a basic income has been actively discussed. This applies mainly to economists, whereas the author puts the question of a basic income in the context of Western social theory. In a situation of ever-accelerating changes that affect society (from technologicalization and automation to the reduction of social time), the world faces many global challenges. A basic income is one of them. The article highlights the reasons for the actualization of the topic of a universal basic income in contemporary social theory of the last ten years. These include automation, the transformation of the economy leading to changes in the types of employment, experiments on the implementation of a basic income in some countries, and most importantly, the discussion of “bullshitization”, which has happened to many jobs in the framework of contemporary financial capitalism (David Graeber). It reveals the understanding of a basic income by its key proponents and theorists (Srnicek, Williams, Van Parijs, Vanderborght, Ford, Graeber, Standing, and others), as well as the fact that freedom is often called as the main goal of a basic income implementation. The paper demonstrates that, in fact, we are mostly talking about the imperative of freedom, which is not always properly clarified. However, it does not matter how freedom is understood in the works of basic income theorists since it is unlikely to be realized in modern socio-economic conditions, and because current capitalism has mutated so much that it now uses the very fabric of human experience rather than labor as its raw material. In this context, talks about automation is more of a thought experiment, and therefore the discussion should be shifted to another perspective.

Accordingly, this study aims to provide some evidence on relative income hypothesis by investigating the relevance of Duesenberry’s demonstration and ratchet effects in Ethiopia using quarterly data from 1999/2000Q1 to 2018/19Q4. We estimate two specifications of the relative income hypothesis using the traditional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and the dynamic ARDL simulations approach. The findings confirm a Backward-J-shaped demonstration effect, implying that an increase in relative income induces a steeper reduction in Average Propensity to Consume (APC) at lower-income groups (the demonstration effect is stronger for lower-income groups). The results also support the ratchet effect, indicating the importance of past consumption habits for current consumption decisions. In resolving the consumption puzzle, the presence of demonstration and ratchet effects reflects a stable APC in the long run. Therefore, consumption-related policies should be carefully designed, as policies aimed at boosting aggregate demand can motivate low-income households to gallop into a wasteful competition to ‘keep up with the Joneses’—the relative riches.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40847-022-00182-4,Keeping up with the Joneses: macro-evidence on the relevance of Duesenberry’s relative income hypothesis in Ethiopia*

But this position does not bear serious scrutiny. As the Supreme Court’s decisions acknowledge, the states’ lawful exercise of their sovereign taxing powers often exposes taxpayers to duplicative state tax burdens. First, the Constitution permits states to use differing rules for determining where income is earned, and these inconsistencies inevitably lead to overlap in the attribution of that income. Second, the Constitution grants states the authority to tax income on the basis of both residency and source, which means that income earned in any state by a nonresident is subject to being taxed twice by different states. Thus, taxpayers engaged in interstate commerce are often exposed to duplicative state-level income taxes—a burden not borne by persons confining their economic activity to one state. Yet, this state of affairs does not offend the Commerce Clause. Properly understood, multiple taxation itself is not a constitutional problem. But state tax schemes that produce multiple taxation are frequently unconstitutional, as they often violate one of the two fundamental limits on states’ taxing authority: (1) that states may only tax income over which they have lawful jurisdiction; and (2) that states may not impose taxes that discriminate against interstate commerce. And this understanding of the role of multiple taxation in constitutional analysis—disentangled from the deeper constitutional principles that constrain a state’s authority to tax income—answers an important question left open by the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne. Specifically, a state’s nondiscriminatory personal income tax on the entirety of its residents’ income—absent any provision protecting taxpayers from duplicative burdens when other states tax that same income—is fully consistent with the dormant Commerce Clause.",,The States' Multiple Taxation of Personal Income

However, this paper posits that his view of self-respect and activity could accommodate its implementation. Rawls lists the social basis of self-respect in social primary goods as the most important good, but does not assume that it is derived from wage labor alone. It appears that his theory of justice aims to criticize the work-centered (wage-labor) society and to overcome it. Besides, as Rawls desires, for our work to be meaningful and our life worthwhile, we should institutionalize basic income because it can improve workers’ bargaining power and their attitude toward work, in addition to enhancing their leisure time.

The most critical aspects of UBI’s impact on the labor market include labor supply and demand, the bargaining power of employees and the situation of employers, and the recognition of socially beneficial work as equivalent to gainful employment. The study aims to analyze the declared impact of the unconditional basic income on the professional situation of one of the groups of its beneficiaries - women whose bargaining power as employees is weakened and who perform socially beneficial housework. The study included in -depth interviews with four women who were on maternity leave. The results showed that UBI influences the position of the employee in the labor market, weakens employers and positively affects employees. The key issue for the respondents is the UBI amount, because a relatively small amount would be treated as additional income. UBI could strengthen the position of mothers with young children, provide greater psychological comfort and enable more effective forms of work, such as remote or part-time work.",https://doi.org/10.2478/fiqf-2023-0009,Impact of the unconditional basic income on the professional situation of women

We then contrast these theoretical expectations with findings from the empirical literature on the effectiveness of integrated approaches. While many empirical studies find positive effects across different labour market dimensions, this is not a universal finding.

-3.3172524,2.9896858,2,"A universal basic income (UBI) is defined as a universal, unconditional cash payment that is made regularly, is sufficient to live on, is not means tested, carries no work requirements and is paid on an individual basis. This study examines the international evidence on universal basic incomes and identifies key issues for consideration in the design of any UBI pilot for Ireland. Despite the mainstream interest in UBI as a potential policy tool, relatively little is known about the associated consequences of such policies. Even the definition of a UBI appears to be poorly understood and is often misused in the public discourse. Several pilot studies have been recently implemented across different countries. However, some pilot studies depart from the accepted definition of UBI. For example, some are not universal, in that they only target a specific subgroup of the population and/or have eligibility restrictions based on earnings. Others provide a relatively low level of payment, which may fall short of what an individual could reasonably be expected to live on. There are a number of potentially positive impacts associated with a UBI. A universal, unconditional payment could eliminate the stigma associated with welfare receipt. If replacing existing welfare payments, a UBI would also involve lower transaction costs, both on the recipient (in terms of the application procedure) and on Government (in terms of administering the payment). Universal, unconditional payments would also avoid situations where people choose not to work in order to retain means-tested benefits. UBI could give individuals the freedom to turn down or leave insecure, exploitative or low-paid work in pursuit of better or improved work opportunities. In addition, it would mean that persons in informal and often unpaid work, such as childcare and eldercare, which is mostly done by women, receive some compensation for their labour. Empirical results from several pilot studies have found evidence of positive health impacts following the implementation of a UBI. In terms of potential disadvantages, a UBI, by definition, may not target those that are most in need, as a large percentage of recipients will be high-earning individuals. Furthermore, the cost of a UBI is likely to be very expensive, even if other existing benefits (such as unemployment benefits) are no longer required. The net impacts of a UBI on labour supply are unclear, with both positive and negative influences on labour market participation potentially arising as a consequence of a UBI. In this study, we undertake some basic calculations relating to four possible UBI approaches, all of which would involve an unconditional payment to every individual aged over 18 in Ireland.",https://doi.org/10.26504/rs146,A universal basic income for Ireland: Lessons from the international literature

This will help protect the unemployed from poverty and stimulate economic growth. Systematization of the literary sources and approaches for solving the problem of improving the quality of life of the poor indicates that the government (led by the African National Congress) since 1994 implemented a social security policy (the child support grant for women). At the same time, the government’s position regarding the feasibility of introducing of basic income grant as a tool for economic stimulation has changed. The African National Congress disagrees with the need for basic income grant as a tool for poverty alleviation and economic growth. The main purpose of the research is the analysis of the prerequisites for the change in the position of the African National Congress regarding the feasibility of introducing basic income grant: basic income grant is a tool for stimulating economic growth and overcoming poverty for most of the disadvantaged population of South Africa, or a means for the government to preserve its positions, which are weakening among the South African electorate. The paper presents the results of an empirical analysis, which proved that basic income grant will contribute to the increase of the national tax base as those not earning an income can start buying and selling goods and be taxed. At the same time, at the initial stage, the introduction of basic income grant will lead to an increase in the level of income taxation of the employed population.

A UBI is a system of direct monetary payments from government coffers to all citizens of a state or locality with the purpose of providing a sum for essential livelihood. In contrast to most current social welfare programs, the UBI requires no means test for the citizen to become a recipient. This idea has attracted attention for the radical simplicity of its design and implementation. Beginning with a discussion of the principles of the UBI, the paper then analyzes how Basic Income compares with other programs of a similar nature. Discussion then moves to a brief review of case studies of UBI and the positive social and economic outcomes observed in those experiments. Theoretical benefits including public and private efficiency gains, reduced governmental administrative costs, and increased labor market mobility are explained along with an assertion on the morality of welfare as it relates to egalitarian ideals. Finally, simple calculations are included to facilitate an examination on the viability of a UBI in the United States. This paper seeks to provide a general understanding of the Universal Basic Income concept to a wide range of audiences and argue for the myriad of significant benefits it could afford in place of current systems of welfare provisioning.

In order to investigate the potential effects of basic income upon social exclusion, traditional quantitative or qualitative methods are not appropriate; therefore this thesis performs a conceptual analysis in relation to the concepts of basic income and social exclusion. To perform a conceptual analysis, a thorough understanding of each concept is first required. Basic income’s advocates justify the idea in many ways, ranging from arguments relating to its ability to provide true freedom to all to arguments viewing basic income as a means of challenging capitalism. Nonetheless, its critics remain, specifically in reference to its unconditional nature. Social exclusion, meanwhile, relates to the involuntary ability of an individual to participate in normal societal activities. Individuals become socially excluded through competition for resources and status within society, with the labor process playing the largest role in the creation of social exclusion.

The analysis of this thesis suggests that basic income has the ability to create a more inclusive society, in which fewer individuals suffer from social exclusion. Specifically, it appears to have considerable influence upon the labor process within society, and more broadly, the entire notion of work. Nevertheless, basic income does not seem to fundamentally alter the mechanisms that create social exclusion, leaving a small share of the population excluded even with a basic income. However, this thesis concludes by arguing that basic income appears to fulfill many of the goals of its advocates, and has the ability to combat social exclusion more effectively than current welfare policies.",,Can Basic Income Combat Social Exclusion?

It begins with a survey of the major normative justifications of basic income and their respective orientations towards capitalist development and labour markets. Next it presents an argument against tying the justification of basic income to posited labour supply responses based on predicted technological change, the extant empirical evidence from pilots or technical policy simulations. It then addresses the politico-cultural barrier to basic income presented by the wage relation and the work ethic, and critically evaluates the ‘exit option’ argument for basic income.

It explores the implications of endogenous fertility for intragenerational welfare comparisons of alternative policies with respect to income taxation and family allowances. Considering that nearly every system of taxation either makes some provision for differences in family size and composition or has provisions that have varying welfare implications depending on such differences, the apparent lack of attention in the theoretical literature to the implications of endogenous fertility is surprising. Tax and family policies designed to affect the distribution of income or welfare that do not take into account their effects on fertility may have unintended consequences. For example, if poverty, in the sense of low family income per capita, tends to be associated with large family size, a system of child allowances and tax exemptions designed to alleviate poverty and reduce inequality may actually worsen the situation. The chapter presents an assumption that preferences are given and homogenous. However, there are differences in exogenous opportunities such as innate abilities that induce differences in income or welfare, and as fertility is endogenous, such differences in opportunities also induce differences in family size.",https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-515752-0.50014-0,Intragenerational Income Distribution Policies

Contrary to the common trope of robots stealing people’s jobs, politics and policies that have allowed for wages to stagnate while both productivity and costs of living were on the rise have led to the need to reassess the nature and role of work in our societies. One line of reasoning is to widen the definition of work by including the large amount of unpaid work in our society, such as caring for children, the sick and the elderly. Another line of reasoning is to disentangle employment and income – Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend was one expression of this growing trend.

-31.145523,37.718994,3,"Universal basic income would provide everyone with a regular cash payment and is, as van Parijs (1992, p 1) observes, a ‘beautifully, disarmingly simple idea’ – as well as one with potentially profound implications. Under conventional social security policies, the groups of people to which transfers are made are restricted on the basis of conditions of category, circumstance and conduct (or behaviour) (Clasen and Clegg, 2007). Basic income sweeps all that away. Box 13.1 summarises the main features and advantages of universal basic income that arise from its simple and unconditional nature. Universal basic income’s appeal traverses a range of political perspectives (Torry, 2016a), giving rise to the common portrayal of basic income as ‘neither right nor left but forward’. At basic income’s heart is a compromise between ‘justice’ and ‘efficiency’ (van Parijs, 1990); proponents argue it is uniquely capable of fulfilling the protective functions of social security while minimising harmful labour market distortions (Martinelli, 2017a). Left-wing inclinations towards equality, solidarity and redistribution are coupled with libertarian ideals of freedom and efficiency. The juxtaposition of political philosophical values enshrined in basic income has a long pedigree; the modern concept can be traced back to Thomas Paine in the 18th century, where it was justified as compensation for infringement of inalienable common property rights through land enclosure (van Parijs, 1992). Since that time, interest in the idea has waxed and waned. However, in the past decade – and especially since 2013 – interest has soared. A number of developments illustrate this shift: a Swiss decision (in 2013) to have a referendum (held in 2016) on whether to grant every citizen an unconditional payment; recent experiments in Namibia and India, and a host of experiments ongoing or planned in Finland, Kenya, the Netherlands, Canada and California; a general flurry of media and public scrutiny; and the growing membership – and sheer number – of organisations supportive of (or at least interested in) the idea of basic income.",https://doi.org/10.51952/9781447339489.ch013,Making it simple?

The contributions to this book have amply shown this to be true. But writing any sort of book on social security is a risky undertaking. When we reflected earlier on the last edition of this book (published in 2009), we noted that it was rooted in the political and economic circumstances at the time. Successive Labour governments from 1997 had maintained consistent policy aims for over a decade – to reduce poverty, especially child poverty, and to promote paid employment – that it pursued through a variety of means, including, but not only, the social security system. But we were not to know as the book was being prepared in 2008 that the global economic and financial systems on which the generally prosperous first decade of this century was built were about to come crashing down. The 2nd edition did not have a chapter called ‘Facing the future’ but we are fairly certain we would not have foreseen Universal Credit, the Bedroom Tax, restricting Child Benefit, the retrenchment in disability-related benefits and the benefits cap as likely developments in the coming years. And we would not have predicted that universal basic income would have become a serious topic of policy debate in the UK and the subject of trials in Finland, the Netherlands and elsewhere (as explained in Chapter 13, by Luke Martinelli).

Since then, a great deal has been written about both automation itself and its effects on industry and employment, including by Martin Ford in his 2009 book The Lights in   Tunnel. Readers who are not already well versed in   gale- force winds caused by automation will find his new book's review of   broad range of recent developments compelling and informative. It would seem, however, that this book's most important feature lies in his joining   many thoughtful observers who point to how America's market economy (and, more broadly, society in general) must be restructured to meet   realities of what can only be described as a radically changing world.By way of summary, he reminds us that the hollowed-out middle of   already polarized job market is likely to expand as robots and self-service technologies eat away at low-wage jobs, while increasingly intelligent algorithms threaten higher-skill occupations. As this occurs, the bulk of consumers may eventually come to lack   income and purchasing power necessary to drive   demand that is critical... If so,   is difficult to see how a modern mass-market economy could continue to thrive. If this is allowed to happen, not only will that economy lose its foundation, but other consequences are bound to follow:   innovation that at present offers so much promise for a near-utopian future will wither with it; there will be social chaos with all its horrific dangers and costs; and even   very wealthy, despite hunkering down in gated communities, will find their lives greatly affected.Much of   book recounts   more recent developments. We will want to review that information before discussing what Ford says about what society must do now. Understanding   technical revolution is a necessary prologue.Recent DevelopmentsThe computerizationFord reminds us that Moore's Law posits that   power roughly doubles every eighteen to twenty-four months. Amazingly, computing power has doubled 27 times since 1958, and Ford tells that it is likely to continue through such things as 3D flash memory chips and exotic carbon-based materials that will replace silicon.This increase in power has made many things possible, including big data collection,   cloud, and   neural networks. GPS (i.e.,   global positioning system) relies on vast amounts of extremely detailed mapping data. The cloud calls into play massive collections of servers connected to   Internet. And artificial neural networks, which Ford tells us were first conceived and experimented with in   late 1940s, have led to deep learning systems that al- ready power   speech recognition capability in Apple's Siri and are poised to accelerate progress in a broad range of applications that rely on pattern analysis and recognition.Ford devotes a chapter to   efforts to expand   intelligence     narrow form now used in virtually all cybernetics.

Unsurprisingly, interest in basic income plans have resurfaced yet again in the post-2008 conjuncture.

Along with a growing number of people in Western Europe, I believe that there is, and, moreover, that this further possible future is more desirable than the three I have just mentioned. Basic income capitalism is the expression I shall use to describe this further possibility. It refers to a socio-economic regime in which the bulk of the means of production is privately owned, while each citizen receives, aside from any income she may derive from participation in the labour or capital markets or may owe to some specific status, a substantial unconditional income. The introduction of such an unconditional income is to be viewed, not as the dismantling, but as the culmination of the welfare state, prepared by welfare state achievements in the same way as the abolition of slavery or the introduction of universal suffrage had been prepared, and made possible, by earlier partial conquests. Awareness of the limitations of the protection afforded by associations for mutual aid, next by compulsory social insurance for all waged workers, finally by a conditional form of guaranteed minimum income, has gradually prepared the minds for this radical step, and has helped build the forces required to bring it about.",https://doi.org/10.1086/293420,Basic Income Capitalism

20.31265,-43.731167,0,"Abstract Severe poverty persists in South Africa in spite of the country's existing social security programmes. Most of the poor live in households that receive no social security benefits at all, and the rest remain poor in spite of the benefits they receive. One of the major causes of the social security system's inability to secure adequate social protection is the low rate of take‐up of these programmes. Extremely poor individuals are likely to fail in large numbers to qualify for a grant with a complicated and expensive means test and application process. Social security reform that fails to address the structural problem of low take‐up is unlikely to yield substantial social benefits. A universal basic income grant, provided as an entitlement and without a means test, will more readily reach the poorest population. By removing the stigma that labels the recipient as “poor”, the grant bolsters economic support without draining psychological resources. Its universal nature addresses the problem of low take‐up, and dispensing with the means test lowers the cost of accessing the grant to both government and beneficiaries. Providing the grant as a fundamental right reduces arbitrary discretion, minimising opportunities for corruption. The basic income grant enables the social security system to reduce the poverty gap by 74%. The basic income grant also supports economic growth through facilitating the accumulation of human and social capital, and job creation, and bolstering aggregate demand in the economy. A well‐managed basic income grant programme is affordable and consistent with fiscal responsibility.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02533950208458733,"The social, economic and fiscal impact of comprehensive social security reform for South Africa"

A microeconomic model is developed to identify the effects of such a grant on the institutional mechanisms governing the supply of work by those employed and the implied effects on the level of wages, profitability an investment. Two questions are posed. First, taking account of the implied effects on wages, labor discipline and taxes, is it possible to introduce a basic income grant without reducing the level of economy with maintainance of the level of profitability and so, what is the largest grant consistent with maintainance of the level of profitability and investment? The answer to the first question is affirmative. The answer to the second is that for an economy such as the United States, the profitability and investment maintaining grant is small but hardly insignificant; its implementation would effect a major redistribution of income from the employed and the unemployed to the non-employed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0176-2680(92)90041-e,Is income security possible in a capitalist economy?

Basic income can play a crucial role in fostering such capacity. Because of its unconditionality, and thanks to bargaining power deriving from it, basic income is a sort of income that is convertible in terms of (a) time to conceive of (and put into practice) projects of one’s own, be it individually and/or collectively; (b) a capacity to explore alternative options and take promising risks; and (c) the right to credit, in the twofold sense of the right to financial resources and the right to social trust. As noticed and appreciated by some post-crash social movements, there are some spheres where such democracy-enhancing bargaining power may unfold: wage-earning work, the decommodification of labour force and the possible subsequent constitution of cooperatives and other self-managed (re)productive spaces, the household, entrepreneurship, socio-political participation, etc. In sum, more flexible combinations of different kinds of work may emerge when individuals and groups enjoy an income stream that is guaranteed as a right, which echoes both classical and contemporary discourses on the need for humans to have the democratic right to autonomously choose and determine work(s) all along the life cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0007,Economic Sovereignty as the Democratization of Work: The Role of Basic Income

The scheme was evaluated by comparing households in villages where everyone received a small cash payment each month with households in similar villages where no one did. The evaluation results showed much stronger than anticipated benefits of a very modest basic income, equivalent to about a third of subsistence. It is argued here that this arises because cash payments alleviate the contrived scarcity of money itself, a cause of chronic indebtedness and impoverishment. Using data and illustrative case studies on debt, savings and financial inclusion, the article demonstrates how a basic income improves economic security beyond its monetary value, which can be termed its emancipatory value. It further concludes that a basic income would have an emancipatory effect for the growing precariat around the world.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2015-0021,Why Basic Income’s Emancipatory Value Exceeds Its Monetary Value

2.4693515,31.750418,2,"Images of free time are used today to give the impression that alienation from work is being alleviated. As a result, exploitation of the workers who are constantly occupied with “self-realization” becomes even more effective. Free time becomes a fetish — a means of productively engaging people’s energy through various scenarios in which they are (supposedly) enjoying their leisure time pursuits. Is it even possible to undo the fetishization of free time? And if so, how else might we conceptualize it? In seeking an answer to these questions the author continues the discussion of akrasia launched by Michail Maiatsky in his article “Liberation from Work, Unconditional Income and Foolish Will” (Logos, 2015, 25[3]) in which Maiatsky expressed a well-founded fear that a contemporary “post-Nietzschean” person might respond to the “gift of unconditional freedom” with an irrational desire to test the boundaries of that boon and end up as Dostoyevsky said “living by his own foolish will.” A hypothesis to address that fear argues that the intentions behind such an “akratic rebellion” are inherently rooted in the fetishistic logic that dominates both current perceptions of free time and also the debate about providing a basic income. The akratic reaction is a form of phantasmatic acting out of the painful suspicion that efforts to reach liberation could turn into another form of bondage. The roots of this bind can be found in the historically embedded form of economic organization, which is based on a sense of dire emergency. We owe this understanding of the “economic dispositive” to the work of Giorgio Agamben, but it is already discernible in Xenophon. We can find an indication of its dominant position in modern economic thinking in Nikolay Sieber’s (1844–1888) criticism of the postulates of the “subjective school” of economics. Because the economy acquires a sacred aspect within this dispositive, akrasia may be compared with a sacrilegious trespass of its boundaries. However, Agamben proposes that challenging any form of the solemn ceremonies of capitalism’s priesthood in a way that is not merely imaginary must necessarily be a kind of profanation.",https://doi.org/10.22394/0869-5377-2019-1-159-186,Defetishizing Free Time: From Akrasia to Profanation

This conclusion follows from a three-part argument. First, if a guaranteed income is in place, all individuals have the same opportunity to live without working. Therefore, those who choose not to work do not take advantage of a privilege that is unavailable to everyone else. Second, in the absence of an unconditional income, society is, in effect, applying the principle, (S)he who does not work, will not eat. If the application of this principle is to be consistent with reciprocity, it must be applied to everyone. Most modern industrial societies exempt many citizens from that choice. For example, the owners of external assets do not face the work-or-starve choice and do take advantage of a privilege that is not available to others. An unconditional guaranteed income is one way to eliminate that violation of reciprocity. Third, this paper addresses the criticism that the guaranteed income exploits middle-class workers by demonstrating that a basic income will have a positive effect on wages, which will at least partially counteract the effect of the taxes needed to pay for it.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329299027003004,Reciprocity and the Guaranteed Income

Our considerations are located in the Marxist tradition and based mainly on contributions to the Marxist analytical framework made by Rosa Luxemburg and Michał Kalecki. We argue that basic income should lead to a rise of the share of wages in the GDP, by significantly improving workers’ bargaining position in various ways: through increasing the effective demand and investments by redistributing income to the advantage of the poorer groups of the society; through guaranteeing the realisation of basic needs outside the labour market; through positive influence on the collective bargaining power, especially during a strike; and through enhancing engagement in alternative relations of production as well as in political struggle for a better situation of working people.

It examines economic activities in relation to a view of welfare as well-being, and to ethics in terms of economic justice. Rather than draw upon abstract ideal theories such as Rawlsian or Capabilities approaches, it calls for an evaluation of actually existing sources of harm and benefit in neoliberal capitalism. It argues that we need to look behind economic outcomes in terms of how much money different people have, examine their economic relations to others, and evaluate the justifications of these relations and their associated rights and practices. It distinguishes three sources of income – earned income, transfers, and unearned income, and argues that the last of these has no functional or ethical justification but has major implications for welfare. It then comments on the policy implications of the argument, including brief comments on asset-based welfare and universal basic income policies, and concludes.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17496535.2017.1377273,Welfare and Moral Economy

Alternatives more aligned with existing programs and policies of social welfare provisioning tend to be taken more seriously by the public at large and policymakers in particular. This chapter, which in part synthesizes related material from a much broader work of mine that examines social welfare policy transitions in the United States from the 1980s through the first years of the Obama administration (Caputo 2011), discusses how a GAI proposal was seriously considered and nearly adopted by the US Congress when deliberating about how to best reform its major welfare program designed primarily for low-income families, especially single-mother families with young children. It highlights the centrality of reciprocity and priority given to labor force attachment as contributing to the loss of popular support for the idea of an unconditional basic income guarantee and shows how alternative policies such as the Earned Income Tax Credit were adopted that fit more readily into a cluster of values and an existing array of social welfare provisioning associated with individual responsibility.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137045300_15,United States of America: GAI Almost in the 1970s but Downhill Thereafter

The 1996 US welfare reform welfare for single mother families was no longer an entitlement and there were stiff work requirements enforced by sanctions and time limits. In Western Europe, although there is variation, welfare has become conditional for social assistance recipients the   excluded. Social assistance is administered at the municipal level, which contracts with private companies. Caseworkers are supposed to make individualized contracts emphasizing work activities. This paper examines the field-level data in several US programs and finds that there is a symbiotic relationship between governments and contractors; caseworkers, whether public or private, focus on process rather than substantive plans; government does not question the data; contracts are imposed; the most employable are placed; and the most vulnerable are sanctioned or otherwise not allowed on welfare. Research in some European countries is showing similar results activation programs are difficult to administer and increase the risks for the most vulnerable. Individualized contracts are a myth, given administrative constraints and client dependency. The paper argues that the difficulties of activation are an additional reason for a basic income guarantee.

It finds that UBI’s supporters and opponents both draw on core principles of justice and freedom, focusing on need and poverty, discrimination and inequality, growth, social opportunity, individuality, and self-development. From an economic perspective, they both appeal to business concerns about efficiency, risk, flexibility, and consumption, as well as labour interests on work fulfilment, working conditions, remuneration, and bargaining. Likewise, they focus on political questions around welfare state reforms, redistribution, taxation and funding sources, democratic citizenship, and the prospects for cross-party policy coalitions.

These programs are categorical in nature in that a family cannot qualify on the basis of low income alone, but must meet other eligibility requirements.

About half of the nation's poor live in such families, yet less than 10% of those families receive any public assistance (Blechman, Gramlich, and Hartman, p. 180). Nor does Unemployment Insurance (UI) do much to fill the gap. Almost half of the male heads of these families work full-time the entire year. Many others receive no UI benefits because they are not covered, because they have been unemployed too long, or because they have had short but frequent periods of joblessness. 1 The only transfer program to which the working poor are universally entitled is the Food Stamp Program. The Food Stamp Program, now offered in all states, is available to all lo income families, but benefits are conditioned upon income. Because of the relative ewness of the program and because of limited outreach efforts, participation in the Food Stamp Program among eligible families is quite low--estimates range from 30% to 60%.

All of the above make the idea of universal mandatory income up-to-date.

The expenses of the redistribution pertaining to basic goods, as well as those associated with public (non-basic) but vital goods, are separately estimated by transforming the expenses into functions of the poverty line. The findings reveal that, along the poverty line that treats all citizens equally, the politicians representing opposing ideologies decide how the redistribution of basic and vital goods should be financed. Politicians should come to an agreement, subject to an approval of their decisions by voters-citizens. However, in the absence of such approval, politicians have no alternative but to continue the negotiations. Based on this premise, we concluded that political decisions with an elevated poverty line as a parameter would give rise to inverse working incentives of benefits claimants. This may result in unbalanced books, due to the expenditure on the delivery of basic and non-basic goods to their respective destinations. By keeping the books in balance, we postulate that one half of median income μ, in accord with Fuchs point, may be used in the form of poverty line ½μ for just and fair wealth redistribution in resolving the ideological controversies between left- and right-wing politicians.

Design/methodology/approach Nationally representative survey data employed in this paper were collected in autumn 2017. The data collection utilized a multiphase sampling, and the interviews ( n =1004) were carried out on telephone to minimize selection-bias and produce demographically balanced data. Findings Over two-thirds (71 percent) of Finns do not expect technological unemployment to constitute a permanent problem in the digital economy. Nevertheless, 74 percent assume that technological unemployment will increase at least temporarily. A considerable majority (85 percent) also believe that future jobs will be more precarious. Younger generations, despite their currently weak position in the labor market, are surprisingly more optimistic in their predictions. Analysis of preferred policy responses support this paper’s main thesis that the Finnish view on the future of work is rather optimistic: education reforms and streamlining the current social security gather dedicated support, whereas more unconventional ideas such as basic income or work-sharing remain contested.

We delineate three types of concerns about capitalism: “Labourist Left” worry about exploitation ; “Libertarian Left” about repression and “Social Investment Left” about inefficiencies . Contrary to expectations we derive from political theory and welfare state literature, our results based on data from the European Social Survey suggest that having high concerns about exploitation is positively correlated with support for UBI, whereas repression concerns are negatively correlated with support. In line with our hypothesis about social investment ideology, left-leaning individuals with efficiency concerns are more likely to support UBI.

In this survey of 836 Americans, we explore whether predicted behavioral responses to four randomly assigned hypothetical cash transfer scenarios vary across the domains of amount and frequency.

21.499699,11.807684,4,"In this article, I raise a justice problem for a universal basic income (UBI) if implemented in one or a few nations, but not globally. I raise this objection from the perspective of someone who is ultimately sympathetic to a UBI, even a merely national one. My argument specifically problematizes the unconditionality of a UBI and the unprecedented benefits for those who receive it. UBI advocates themselves often draw attention to this unconditionality in order to justify the greater moral appeal of a UBI over other schemes. Thus, my argument has particular relevance for those sympathetic to a UBI. I argue that, in response to the justice problem I raise, a merely national UBI should be accompanied by compensation for non-UBI-recipients who contribute to what I will call the UBI's ‘effectiveness’. In Section I, I explain what I mean by a merely national UBI, and in Section II, I develop a justice or exploitation problem that a merely national UBI faces. In Section III, I argue for a compensation scheme for non-recipient contributors. In Section IV, I clarify the scope of my argument, and in Section V, I discuss how my argument relates to a potential global UBI. A UBI is income paid irrespective of willingness to work, of wealth, of other sources of income, and of personal circumstances. If a UBI is pitched at a sufficiently high level, it realizes a number of goods for its recipients: it frees them from the most basic forms of economic insecurity without conditions such as a work requirement,1 affords so-called ‘real freedom’, the freedom to choose the way recipients want to live,2 and allows recipients to exit unattractive jobs and even the job market altogether.3 If a UBI realizes these goods for a recipient, I will say that the UBI is effective. In the next section, I will argue that it is unjust if a merely national UBI is made more effective by the exploitative labour of those who do not receive a UBI and thus cannot opt out of their unattractive jobs, lack the freedom to live as they want, and are subject to basic economic insecurity. A UBI is currently often presented as a radical yet feasible solution to pressing political and social problems, such as poverty,4 the demeaning nature of conditional welfare schemes,5 costly and overly bureaucratic welfare-state regulations,6 the drive for ever more growth and the resulting environmental destruction,7 the fact that much necessary care work is currently not financially rewarded,8 and that workers are increasingly being replaced by robots and computers.9 For my purpose, two things are especially significant. Firstly, a UBI is frequently presented as a non-utopian proposal that, from an economic perspective, could be implemented in some countries now or in the near future.10 Secondly, a global UBI, by contrast, would require major political, economic, and social changes worldwide. This is currently rather utopian, though perhaps ‘no longer a mere pipe dream’.11 A UBI, insofar as it is intended as a solution to some of the most pressing issues of our time and one that is financially and politically feasible now or in the near future, will be one implemented in only a few and, most likely, relatively wealthy countries.12 This raises the question of how a merely national UBI would be impacted by and, in turn, affect the current unequal und unjust global order. The problem I raise in this section is a more pressing version of the already well-known exploitation or free-rider objection to UBI. My problem is concerned with the exploitation specifically of non-nationals or non-residents, who contribute to but do not benefit from a merely national UBI. The literature pays surprisingly little attention to injustices between different nations that a merely national UBI might amplify. In fact, discussions of exploitation and unfairness within the UBI literature take place almost exclusively on an intra-national level.13 The original exploitation objection is inspired by Rawls's claim that Malibu surfers are not entitled to public funds.14 The (in)famous surfer is someone who could contribute to society either via paid work or in other socially beneficial ways, but, instead, spends all his time surfing. While the surfer potentially poses a problem for all government schemes founded on cooperation between citizens, the objection is particularly pressing for a UBI, as here benefits are explicitly not conditional upon willingness to cooperate, for example by seeking paid employment. UBI advocates see this unconditionality as a feature, not a bug.15 Nonetheless, in the case of the surfer, a UBI seems to clash with ‘a widely accepted notion of justice: it is unfair for able bodied people to live off the labour of others’.16 This objection is sometimes phrased in terms of unfairness, sometimes in terms of exploitation or parasitism, since the surfer lives off the labour of others who (supposedly) do not receive adequate compensation for the services they perform. I take it that the underlying intuition is that it is unjust if one person's lifestyle is subsidized by the labour of other persons and there is no reciprocity in this subsidy, even though the first person could reciprocate. There is a straightforward response to the surfer problem. Take Lazy (the surfer) and Crazy, who works hard and whose income and other taxes help fund a UBI that allows Lazy to spend all of his time surfing. Crazy cannot reasonably complain about this, since, if he finds the lifestyle of Lazy more appealing than his own, he could give up his job and become a surfer himself. After all, an effective UBI affords him the real freedom to live this way. If Crazy does not give up his job, then this is because he chooses the life of work and higher income—in which case both Lazy and Crazy live the life they chose, and the UBI is working out well for both. Thus, Lazy is not exploiting Crazy, since Crazy can withdraw his labour and is afforded the same economic security and freedom to live the life of his choosing as Lazy. I find this response to the original surfer problem persuasive.17 Things would be different, however, if someone in Crazy's position could not choose to give up their job and become a (financially adequately supported) surfer, because they (I'll call them ‘Exploited’) are neither citizen nor resident18 of a country that pays a UBI. Given the globalized world that we live in, Exploited might well perform work that benefits Lazy as well as Crazy. Such work can be a subsidy of their lifestyles if Exploited's labour is cheaper than the labour of those in the same strong bargaining position as Lazy and Crazy to demand higher pay or better working conditions. After all, Lazy and Crazy have the freedom and security to opt out of work altogether. If it is unjust that someone's lifestyle is subsidized by the labour of another person and there is no adequate reciprocity in this subsidy, then a merely national UBI suffers from a justice problem with regard to the subsidies Lazy and Crazy receive from Exploited and the lack of reciprocity. In the debate about the fairness of a UBI there is much concern about non-contributors, such as the Malibu surfer, receiving benefits. There is much less concern about people who do contribute, but do not receive benefits because they are of a different nationality or live in a different country.19 The latter, it seems to me, constitutes the most pressing justice problem. Let me spell this out in more detail. A merely national UBI excludes certain people as recipients, even if they contribute to the effectiveness of the UBI in that country. They can make such a contribution by subsidizing UBI recipients with their cheap labour, which increases the relative value of the UBI for recipients, as it makes products and services more affordable than they would be if everyone received a UBI. This impacts what and how much those living off a UBI can afford, the opportunities open to them, and how attractive it is for them to exit jobs (or to reduce hours), and thus whether the UBI realizes the goods that it promises, and to what extent it does so. These subsidies for UBI recipients would be, in one sense, not dissimilar from currently existing conditions. After all, the citizens of developed countries already benefit from global inequalities, poor working conditions, and low pay in developing countries where people are forced to work to meet their basic needs. However, there currently exists a work requirement even in wealthy countries, whereas there would be no such requirement for those enjoying an effective UBI. It is reasonable to assume that if non-recipient contributors were not forced to work for their subsistence, because they also enjoyed a UBI that frees them of the need to work for their subsistence, then some services and goods that are currently offered or produced cheaply would become more expensive. The subsidies would likely (at least in part) disappear, and the UBI thus become less effective for recipients. A prime example for exploitation, that subsidizes the citizens of wealthy countries and that many individuals in developing countries would be unlikely to put up with if they were in a position to opt out, is so-called sweatshop labour.20 I take it that sweatshop labour is a relatively uncontroversial example of exploitation.21 The low pay and bad conditions in sweatshops are (part of) the reason why this work is profitable for their owners and why this mode of production can benefit end-consumers. Even after the introduction of a global UBI (or a merely national UBI in countries with sweatshops), there may be people willing to manufacture the type of products formerly produced in sweatshops, but they would presumably need stronger financial incentives and would be able to demand better working conditions that would make these products more expensive. Now, imagine that Exploited works in a factory that builds surf equipment and, due to poor working conditions and low pay for her and her colleagues, this equipment is significantly cheaper than equipment produced by Lazy's fellow citizens who enjoy a UBI and lack strong financial incentives to work in a surfboard factory for low pay. In an extreme case, the only surf equipment Lazy can afford from his UBI is equipment produced by Exploited. Without this cheap supply of equipment, it would not be possible for Lazy to live the pure lifestyle of a surfer and he would have to take up (part-time) employment to afford his equipment. A UBI then allows Lazy to live the way he wants only because of the labour of Exploited, who, unlike Crazy, does not have the option to withdraw her labour and live off a UBI. Even if Exploited does not manufacture the specific products that Lazy needs to live the pure lifestyle of a surfer, as long as she does manufacture products or render services that Lazy or Crazy want or need, and does so more cheaply than if she were able to opt out of work, the UBI that Lazy and Crazy enjoy goes further in terms of purchasing power than it otherwise would. Part of the value of a merely national UBI for recipients thus stems from the fact that this UBI is merely national and that it still leaves in place sources of cheap labour elsewhere. One might respond that my empirical assumption that a global UBI would dry up sources of cheap labour and drive up prices is questionable. After all, one of the potential advantages of a UBI is that it removes financial disincentives to take up low-paid or precarious work; disincentives put in place by misjudged tax and welfare systems that leave people financially better off on welfare than in work or that effectively impose high taxes on low incomes. People might still want to work to top up their UBI and they would not need a subsistence wage in return. Thus, a UBI might even make certain products and services cheaper. I think that intrinsically rewarding or meaningful work might become cheaper, if people enjoyed a UBI and could choose their occupations without having to earn a living. However, it is also plausible to assume that recipients of a subsistence-level UBI would be unlikely to take up a substantial amount of sweatshop-type labour, unless these jobs were paid significantly better and/or working conditions much improved (and would thus no longer qualify as sweatshop labour). After all, one of the main benefits of a UBI is that it grants recipients the freedom to decline or exit unattractive jobs and even escape ‘forced labor market participation’ altogether.22 What, if any, jobs would UBI recipients want to decline if not poorly paid, dangerous jobs, involving repetitive labour, coercion, and health risks? Thus, it is plausible to assume that many currently cheap products would become more expensive if, globally, everyone enjoyed a UBI.23 This would reduce the living standards of people in high-income countries subsisting on a fixed income in the form of a UBI, and might even reintroduce the necessity to work. The effectiveness of a UBI in providing basic financial security and allowing recipients to live as they wish depends in some measure on cheap (and exploitative) labour by those not enjoying a UBI. My argument above notwithstanding, a merely national UBI would be an effective tool to combat many forms of injustice within that nation. After all, even in wealthy nations many citizens are in precarious and vulnerable financial positions that employers, corporations, loan sharks, and the government can exploit. A merely national UBI, if pitched at the right level and financed in the right way, would serve justice within that society, and it would therefore be premature to dismiss it. There is a parallel case that demonstrates how defenders of a UBI can respond to the justice problem raised in the previous section: namely, the ethical debate about the harmful climate impact of Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD). Since 1982 the US state of Alaska pays an annual dividend—$1,114 in 2021—to all its residents. The PFD represents the largest example of a UBI paid over a prolonged period (albeit not at subsistence level). Moreover, the Alaska financing model, taxing natural resource appropriation, is attractive to UBI advocates, since many other financing models, such as income tax or VAT, disproportionately affect working people and/or people on low incomes.24 Steve Winter, however, argues that the ‘PFD makes participating recipients complicit with grave wrongdoing because of its connection to the oil industry, a practice responsible for 150,000 deaths per annum’.25 Winter's argument is, in short, that the oil industry involves intrinsic wrongs, and that the Alaskan PFD makes recipients complicit in intrinsic wrongs. This complicity is itself wrongful. Winter does not think that his objection is ‘devastating’ for the Alaska model.26 He proposes ‘to combine basic income payments with sufficient funding to stop the killings’.27 Since the oil industry28 does not kill anyone directly, but rather costs lives due to indirect effects such as disease, extreme weather events, and other foreseeable effects of global warming, adequate preventive and remedial measures could be taken to remove the reason to object to the Alaska model. The Alaska model would then have two components: ‘Funding derived from natural resource appropriation would provide monies for a basic income and to prevent the deaths that would otherwise occur due to climate change’.29 This latter scheme would not have to prevent all deaths that occur from climate change, as Alaska is globally only a relatively minor source of oil. It would merely have to mitigate ‘those negative effects (we are focusing on unjustifiable deaths) that could be attributed to the industry in question’30—meaning, specifically the Alaskan oil industry. Winter calculates that averting 405 killings per year would be sufficient to ‘discharge Alaskans’ “fair share” of responsibility’ for the wrongful killings.31 He also emphasizes that this move is applicable to all models of financing a UBI based on harmful resource extraction.32 He does not, however, generalize his argument to other ethical challenges for a UBI. The general intuition behind Winter's idea is that those who benefit from unjust arrangements have stringent obligations to compensate victims. This principle is not limited to a merely national UBI made (more) effective by exploitation. In the next section, I will discuss whether it makes a moral difference if exploitation specifically props up a merely national UBI. For now, I will show that a plausible reply to the problem I discussed in the previous section is to take up a modified version of Winter's suggestion of providing what he calls ‘avert-funding’. I will phrase my own proposal in terms of compensation, specifically for those who contribute to a merely national UBI but do not receive a UBI. To better understand this proposal, let us look at four salient points of comparison between the problems of the Alaska model and the global justice problem from the previous section. Firstly, Winter stresses that ‘Alaskans are not guilty of’ the deaths resulting from the oil industry.33 Mere complicity in a wrong is less severe than committing the wrong itself. This point is important, since avert-funding or compensation usually would not be an adequate response to wrongs that an agent herself commits. If I murder you, I cannot plausibly compensate for this by donating money to buy medicine that saves someone else's life. Compensation schemes are appropriate for wrongs which I am complicit in or benefit from, but of which I am not the perpetrator. The perpetrator's primary duty is to refrain from wrongdoing, not to offset the negative effects or avert harm elsewhere. Winter suggests that complicity in the Alaska PFD is ‘equivalent in veniality with wearing sweatshop clothing’.34 This is quite a contentious claim, since being complicit in killing is commonly considered much worse than complicity in various forms of exploitation. Presumably, Winter's point is here not about the impact of killing and exploitation on victims, but about illustrating the structure of moral responsibility. The idea is that agents are not actively harming anyone themselves, but they are complicit. Importantly, this is already the case for the globally affluent who do not receive a UBI, but who are buying sweatshop products, making them complicit in exploitation. There would, however, be an important sense in which merely national UBI recipients’ complicity had an additional dimension. As I suggested in the previous section, if it were not for cheap foreign labour that benefits the citizens of wealthy nations, a merely national UBI might not be sufficient to cover the basic needs of recipients, and thus to perform some of its most beneficial functions. Moreover, even if a merely national UBI covered basic needs without cheap labour from abroad, its relative value increases due to this cheap labour. UBI recipients’ real freedom is subsidized by the labour of those forced to work for their subsistence. Secondly, Winter thinks that mere benefiting from wrongful actions is not sufficient for complicity in an ethically relevant sense. He stresses that ‘[t]he wrongfulness exposed by the complicity argument does not depend on benefits but rather upon wrongful agency’.35 By contrast, the problem I bring up draws on both wrongful agency and benefiting. Wrongful agency, for instance, obtains in consumer choices when we knowingly buy products produced under exploitative conditions. Moreover, we benefit from wrongful structures, if we receive a UBI the effectiveness of which is enhanced by exploitation. Wrongful agency and benefiting raise several complicated issues concerning voluntariness. After all, one might argue that you are not morally responsible for benefiting from something that you have no say in—for instance, because your government transfers money to your bank account every month whether you want it or not.36 One way to address the global justice problem I brought up in the previous section would be to give potential recipients the opportunity to opt out of the UBI, an opportunity that exists for the Alaska PFD.37 However, unlike a compensation scheme, opting out of the UBI would not leave non-recipient contributors materially any better off. Moreover, it might still be a problem if certain (already privileged) people can opt in or out, an opportunity denied to non-recipient contributors. Finally, if people opted out of the UBI, then this might necessitate the reintroduction of welfare schemes that secure their subsistence if they become indigent. This would presumably leave unsatisfied those UBI advocates who emphasize the benefits of the universal coverage of a UBI.38 Thirdly, Winter maintains that ‘Oil exploitation is not wrongful in itself’, but that the production of greenhouse gas, which causes additional deaths, ‘is a normal component of the industry’.39 In the case of exploitation of people, as in sweatshop labour, early deaths, due to workplace accidents, are fairly abnormal, but other impacts, such as negative long-term health consequences for workers, lost time with family and friends due to long shifts, lost opportunities, and so on, are inextricable features of the industry. The exploitation I am concerned with is not an unintended by-product, but essential to the high profit margins of sweatshop labour. Thus, the problem I raised is, in one sense, more worrying than the rather indirect effects of the oil industry. It is, I take it, plausible that someone who benefits from exploiting people has a more stringent duty to compensate victims than someone who benefits from resource extraction that, as a normal or even necessary side-effect, is also harmful to some people. However, my proposal does not hinge on this specific intuition. Fourthly, there is an important sense in which a merely national UBI, as well as the Alaska PFD, are both innocuous. In both cases the victims (of climate change or exploitation) are not made worse off by the redistribution of revenues in the form of a merely national UBI. The victims of climate change would die even if a private corporation pocketed Alaska's oil revenue. Analogously, whether consumers do or do not receive a UBI leaves sweatshop workers’ working conditions and pay untouched, or at least there is no immediate connection here. This might well impact the stringency of duties of compensation that those benefiting from their labour have. In fact, I think that, since a merely national UBI does not make victims of exploitation worse off, a compensation scheme is the right middle ground between, on the one hand, opposing a merely national UBI on ethical grounds and, on the other hand, leaving the exploitation problem of a merely national UBI unaddressed. Winter proposes avert-funding that would save as many lives from the effects of climate change as the Alaska oil industry is responsible for taking, and he presents a clear number for this: namely, 405 lives. By contrast, it is very difficult to quantify how many people would have to be exploited for a merely national UBI to be effective, and this would greatly depend on the circumstances of the recipients as well as the contributors, and on overall political and economic conditions. It is therefore impossible to determine a concrete number of people that an avert mechanism must protect from exploitation. Furthermore, unlike those killed by climate change, the current victims of exploitation are still alive.40 In addition, whereas the effects of climate change are random, in the sense that we do not know which specific individuals will die or otherwise suffer from it (though we do know that some groups and regions are much more likely to be affected than others), there are concrete individuals whose work would benefit the recipients of a merely national UBI. These non-recipient contributors are owed something, and it would not be adequate to merely combat or avert exploitation somewhere, if we can at least approximately identify these contributors. My proposed compensation scheme, therefore, is not a form of avert-funding, but rather funding that aims to benefit specifically non-recipient contributors to a merely national UBI. This can take the relatively general form of benefiting anyone from whose exploitation recipients of a UBI benefit. For instance, fair-trade practices or even higher standards could be made legally mandatory and appropriate resources could be allocated to enforce these standards.41 We can also imagine more targeted measures that specifically benefit workers in developing countries manufacturing products and providing services crucial to the citizens of the country that introduced a merely national UBI, insofar as it is possible to single out specific factories or regions where this labour is performed. One such targeted measure could be direct money transfers to workers who have worked a set number of years or who have become unable to work. Another could be to relax immigration restrictions for non-recipient contributors, so that it becomes easier for them to become residents or citizens of the country that implemented the merely national UBI, and to set up funds to help them make the journey and settle in. This, of course, should not happen only once, but for each successive generation of non-recipient contributors replacing those who have retired or migrated. There are, admittedly, major problems of application here, since global supply and production chains are complex and often cross more than one border. Moreover, one might wonder whether our conception of who contributes to the effectiveness of a merely national UBI should include not only workers who manufacture cheap products, but also people who produce food and other necessary goods and services for these workers, or who perform unpaid reproductive labour that allows workers to produce goods and services as cheaply as they do. I cannot address these problems here. Maybe the best we could do would be to start with a few cases of exploitative labour that clearly benefit many UBI recipients and then extend the compensation scheme gradually, according to our best understanding of global supply chains.42 To clarify the scope of my scheme, I should note that my concern is not poverty and inequality—as is, for instance the focus of Thomas Pogge's Global Resource Dividend43—but exploitation that contributes to the effectiveness of a merely national UBI. Not all of the globally poor would contribute to a merely national UBI, and not all non-recipient contributors are among the world's poorest. My proposal leaves open the prospect that there are additional duties to compensate, because global poverty is due to structures put in place by the globally affluent and from which the affluent benefit regardless of whether they enjoy a UBI. In fact, I believe that my argument does not reveal an entirely new duty to compensate, but rather that it amplifies pre-existing duties to compensate for global injustices. It seems relatively uncontroversial that there are duties to compensate for exploitation or to try to reset (international) relationships so that they become non-exploitative. This is so regardless of whether nations have implemented a merely national UBI. This raises the question of what exactly is the role of a merely national UBI for my argument.44 At the very least, my argument functions as a prod to make global justice issues more central to the debate about the prospects and drawbacks of a merely national UBI. This is potentially already quite powerful, since some of the most persuasive arguments for a UBI are explicitly moral ones. A UBI is presented as something that individuals are owed as a matter of justice qua entitlement to the commons,45 or as a matter of social and economic justice.46 If there are significant moral reasons for adopting a UBI, then any discussion of the moral advantages of a UBI should consider how it might impact and interact with unjust global structures. My argument also provides additional reasons for compensating exploited workers. It thus amplifies the duty that privileged Westerners already have to compensate those from whose exploitation they benefit. How strong these additional reasons are, and to what extent a pre-existing duty is intensified, depend on why one thinks that a UBI is better than other ways of distributing resources (some of which were obtained unfairly). Those who advocate for a UBI assume that it offers concomitant goods or benefits that other schemes, such as conditional welfare provision, participation income, and so on, do not provide, though a UBI may not be the only scheme that provides some of those special goods. As I pointed out at the beginning of this article, various UBI advocates emphasize different, albeit often in practice overlapping, goods. An effective UBI frees recipients from the most basic forms of economic insecurity and does so without a work requirement, affords real freedom, and allows recipients to say no to employment. If one thinks that a UBI is to be preferred over (many or all) other schemes because it can realize special goods, then, I take it, one should be very concerned if these special goods are not available to some people who contribute to the effectiveness of the UBI. These additional goods that some enjoy at the expense of others exacerbate existing exploitation problems, since the privileged here do not merely obtain more of the same—for example, more purchasing power due to the labour of workers with already lower purchasing power. Rather, goods, exceeding what is currently provided by existing schemes, are now enjoyed by some, in part due to the work of others who lack these goods entirely.

That means that families where one spouse earns more than the other get taxed at a higher rate than families where two working partners earn the same total income split evenly between two paycheques. In fact, a family with just a single earner making $70,000 a year pays 30 per cent more in taxes every year than a family with two partners making $35,000 a year. A single-earner family taking in $120,000 a year pays the same income tax as a dual earning couple making $141,000 between them.The federal Conservative government has at least suggested it wants to finally level that playing field — nearly six decades after a royal commission recommended that the income tax system be changed to recognize total family household income, rather than focusing on each individual’s income. Given that Canada’s income tax system aims to treat people in similar circumstances as equally as possible, it is certainly time to let couples split their income so they do not face a penalty in higher tax rates than those faced by couples bringing home the same amount of total pay.While couples with just a single earner enjoy some advantages, a dual-earning couple does not — namely the extra time the stay-at-home spouse is able to use to raise children and produce other unpaid, home-based benefits — that can be accounted for using other means. Specifically, cutting out the transferability of the unused portion of the basic personal tax exemption for couples splitting income — requiring couples splitting their income to each earn money in order to use this credit — is one way to account for the difference in unpaid benefits that single-income families do typically enjoy more than dual-income couples.That is one mechanism; there may still be others the government might consider. But the bottom line is that there are ways to account for certain non-labour-market-related differences between single-earner families and dual-earner families.No doubt many of these proposals would be an improvement over the current, where two different families subsisting on the same pay are taxed very differently, with one type of family penalized simply because of how their income is earned.",,No More Second-Class Taxpayers: How Income Splitting Can Bring Fairness to Canada's Single-Income Families

The growing leniency and generosity of public income support systems has been hypothesized to negatively affect work effort. The magnitude of this effect is estimated for the U. S. and the Netherlands in the 1970s, using a three-stage Probit-OLS model employed on micro data sets. Individuals are viewed as choosing the number of hours worked on the basis of expected labor income, expected transfer income, labor market and demographic characteristics and health. The elasticity of annual hours worked with respect to expected transfer income was estimated to be -0.22 for U. S. and -0.82 (1980) for the Netherlands. Combining these elasticities with the annual percentage increases in transfer generosity yields a yearly reduction in the number of hours worked of 0.65% for the U. S. and 2.7% for the Netherlands during the 1970s. These results suggest that growing transfers have had a substantial and negative impact on desired work effort and thus on production and economic performance, especially in the Netherlands.

Der vorliegende Aufsatz beschaftigt sich mit den annahmegemass negativen Auswirkungen des leichter werdenden Zugangs zum Sozialversicherungssystem sowie der steigenden Hohe der Transferleistungen auf das Arbeitsangebot. Mit Hilfe eines dreistufigen Probit-OLS-Modells wird dieser negative Effekt fur die Vereinigten Staaten und fur die Niederlande aufgrund von Mikrodaten geschatzt. Dabei wird von der Annahme ausgegangen, dass die Wirtschaftssubjekte ihr Arbeitsangebot auf der Basis des erwarteten Arbeitseinkommens, des erwarteten Transfereinkommens, der Arbeitsmarktbedingungen sowie demographischer und gesundheitlicher Faktoren bestimmen. Fur das Jahr 1980 wurden mit Hilfe der oben genannten Methode Elastizitaten der jahrlichen Arbeitsstunden in bezug auf das erwartete Transfereinkommen von -0,22 fur die Vereinigten Staaten beziehungsweise von -0,82 fur die Niederlande geschatzt. Eine Anwendung dieser Elastizitatswerte auf die stetig wachsenden Transfereinkommen fuhrt zu dem Endergebnis, dass auf Jahresbasis gerechnet das Arbeitsangebot wahrend der siebziger Jahre in den Vereinigten Staaten mit 0,65% beziehungsweise in den Niederlanden mit 2,7% abgenommen hat. Dieses Ergebnis zeigt, dass zunehmende Transferausgaben nicht zuletzt in den Niederlanden einen wesentlichen Einfluss auf das Arbeitsangebot und somit auf die gesamtwirtschaftliche Entwicklung haben.

44.258053,-21.794312,4,"Abstract Welfare was reformed significantly in 1996, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was expanded substantially during the last decade. In the wake of these events, welfare rolls have shrunk dramatically and employment among the poor has increased, leading many to conclude that these policies have achieved important equity and efficiency goals. It is argued here that these conclusions are too strong. The work requirements and time limits of welfare reform create equity outcomes that are dubious and leave the potential for inefficiencies in the allocation of labor. The EITC excludes almost half of the poor population under age 65, rewards poorer working families less well than it does less poor working families, and provides a sizable work disincentive for a large proportion of its recipients. It is shown here that the poor are not homogeneous. Specifically, the very poor have a much higher incidence of physical and other disabilities.

While recent studies recognise the multidimensionality of the UBI proposal, we still know little about to what extent support for UBI is unambiguously supported or rejected. We show that the public holds distinct but related opinions towards three dimensions of UBI: universalism, redistribution and unconditionality. The higher and lower educated are equally ambivalent towards the policy, suggesting a lack of political entrenchment towards UBI in Dutch society. Post hoc comparisons show that key demographics and constituencies support some dimensions while rejecting others, enabling both compromise and division on the issue. Despite these distinct controversies, however, the strong correlation between attitudinal dimensions suggests that survey experiments tend to overstate the degree of multidimensionality by ignoring the strong commonalities in support for policy aspects.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ijsw.12607,Dimensions of controversy: Investigating the structure of public support for universal basic income in the Netherlands

-9.443763,13.346048,2,"The article examines the relationship between the introduction of unconditional basic income (UBI) and the satisfaction of needs according to the motivation theories of A. Maslow, D. McClelland, and others. UBI is a guaranteed minimum, which the state pays to every citizen, regardless of his contribution to the economy. It has been found that the idea of UBI has a long history, but its academic research began only in the second half of the 20th century due to the topic’s potential in reforming the social protection systems of developed countries. The purpose of the article is to assess the satisfaction of human needs as a result of the introduction of UBI in the context of various socio-economic systems (capitalism, socialism, socialism with Chinese characteristics, and communism). During the research, general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction were used. The content of motivation theories as a whole is highlighted and their evolution is briefly outlined. It is determined that the basic income should ensure the satisfaction of the fundamental needs of the first and second levels and contribute to increasing the level of the individual’s needs. It is shown that the implementation of the UBI in socio-economic systems built on the foundations of various ideologies is most likely to lead to positive consequences, despite the existing limitations. It is concluded that the main result of USI’s application will be the weakening of competition for resources and the formation of potential for the individual’s self-development, which would contribute to the growth of human capital. At the same time, it is emphasized that it is not impossible to solve, with the help of basic income the fundamental problems of inequality, which is characteristic of both developing and developed countries, and which causes competition. Through further research, it will be possible to develop more effective and balanced approaches to the use of basic income in economic systems, taking into account the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.",https://doi.org/10.15407/etet2023.02.105,The impact of unconditional basic income on the satisfaction of basic needs in the context of different socio-economic systems: advantages and limitations

It advances an approach that balances three aspects of RtS, namely, protection from harmful science, benefit-sharing and participation in science and derives three corresponding sets of state duties. First, RtS implies the duty to end data monetization in so far as it entails practices harmful to human rights, including unlawful interference with privacy. Second, while data monetization exists, RtS entails the duty to distribute monetary benefits through an RtS-based universal basic income (UBI). Third, RtS entails the duty to facilitate ordinary people’s participation in DS and prioritize non-profit pro-social uses of DS as in citizen or community DS. The proposed RtS analysis of DS engages policy responses to artificial intelligence (AI) and material inequality, namely, AI regulation, monetary benefits from data, UBI and the ‘data for good’ movement.

20.021463,-25.857214,0,"What are the consequences of a nationwide reform of a transfer system based on means-testing toward one of unconditional transfers? I answer this question with a quantitative model to assess the general equilibrium, inequality, and welfare effects of substituting the current US income security system with a universal basic income (UBI) policy. To do so, I develop an overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic income risk that incorporates intensive and extensive margins of the labor supply, on-the-job learning, and child-bearing costs. The tax-transfer system closely mimics the US design. I calibrate the model to the US economy and conduct counterfactual analyses that implement reforms toward a UBI. I find that an expenditure-neutral reform has moderate impacts on agents’ labor supply response but induces aggregate capital and output to grow due to larger precautionary savings. A UBI of $1,000 monthly requires a substantial increase in the tax rate of consumption used to clear the government budget and leads to an overall decrease in the macroeconomic aggregates, stemming from a drop in the labor supply. In both cases, the economy has more equally distributed disposable income and consumption. The UBI economy constitutes a welfare loss at the transition if it is expenditure-neutral and results in a gain in the second scenario.",https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202121,The Macroeconomic Effects of Universal Basic Income Programs

However, the empirical evidence to support this position is currently lacking and the concept of an ecological BI (EBI) is underdeveloped.

Part two examines how BI interventions consider the principles of an EBI in their designs and discusses what their findings infer about BI’s ecological credentials. The results find that while ecological considerations are largely absent from BI intervention designs, their findings suggest that interventions aligned with the principles of an EBI could play a role in addressing the ecological crises.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0044,An Ecological Basic Income?

It discusses the implications of each on notions of and reform efforts for social or distributive justice. The core critique is that neither Van Parijs nor Zucker come to terms adequately with absolute poverty when addressing issues of income inequality. Reducing income inequality, a worthy goal for a variety of reasons (e.g., equalizing access to political power, creating greater social harmony), may reduce relative poverty while nonetheless ignoring absolute poverty. The author argues that poverty reduction should remain the central focus of theoretical and practical initiatives justifying income redistribution. That is, attending to basic need is necessarily elemental, can be made consistent with the idea of a UBI, and enhances the force of the concept of social or distributive justice.

12.611847,-0.797794,4,"The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a significant source of government assistance to low income families. Total outlay reached over $50 billion in 2008, with more than 97 percent of aid received by families with children (Internal Revenue Service 2011). Despite its size and pro-child goals, relatively little is known about how the EITC affects children directly. Until recently, studies focused only on indirect measures of child well-being such as poverty, parental labor supply, marriage, fertility, and consumption. This study directly links EITC receipt throughout all ages of childhood to both contemporaneous achievement and long-run educational attainment. I take advantage of both Federal tax code changes and state EITC adoptions, which result in large variation in EITC generosity across state, time, and family size. Using the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), I find that EITC expansions improve both contemporaneous and long-run educational outcomes of children. An increase in the maximum EITC of $1,000 (2008 dollars) in a given year significantly increases math achievement by about 0.072 nationally normed standard deviations. This change in EITC generosity during childhood also increases the probability of graduating high school or receiving a GED at age 19 by about 2.1 percentage points and increases the probability of completing one or more years of college by age 19 by about 1.4 percentage points. Estimated effects are larger for boys and minority children, and I find evidence that an expansion in the EITC is more effective at improving educational outcomes for children who are younger during the expansion. An increase in the maximum EITC of $1,000 also results in other changes in the household, including an increase in net family income inclusive of EITC and welfare payments of about $888 and an increase in maternal labor force participation.",,"Essays on income, social policy, and education"

Individuals in the labour market at the time of the reform were given the choice to either stay in the old PAYG system or to opt-out to the DC scheme, whereas new entrants must join the DC system. Exploiting the wide differences in pension formulas across schemes, in this paper we analyse for whom it was financially optimal (in terms of higher net present value of expected pension wealth, EPW) to opt-out and for whom to stay in the PAYG system. Using self-reported employment and contribution histories, we compute the net present value of EPW each individual in our sample will get in the pension scheme he is currently enrolled to and the pension he would have got had he made the opposite staying/opting-out out decision. We find that overall 87% of individuals would have got a higher pension in the DC system than what they would have got in the PAYG scheme. This share varies significantly by cohort but not so much by education or sex. When looking at who actually maximised the net present value of EPW when choosing pension arrangement the results show that 57% did. Thus, when faced with the choice of pension system, only over half of individuals took the financially right decision. Responses vary across current pension system: while 90% of men and 80% of women currently in the PFA maximised the net present value of EPW, less than 15% of individuals currently in the PAYG did.",,Did Chileans Maximize Pensions when Choosing between PAYG and DC

The article investigates the question whether the continental European   state show an in-built tendency towards illusions about their real wealth and the degree of their insuredness against old age poverty. It analyzes this tendency as welfare state   in analogy to Ricardos public debt illusion. Since people act under the assumption of a constant population they tend to overestimate systematically the value of their accumulated claims to the social insurance. The value of their claims to the public pension system is indeed much lower under conditions of shrinking populations then they assume. This   state illusion leads to the disappointment of expectations concerning the level of the old age pensions and to conflicts with the younger generation that has to work for the old age pensions. According to the author of the article, this question of the short term intergenerational justice of generations presently living is much more central then the question of justice towards future generations, a problem also often discussed under the label of intergenerational justice.

Beveridge's vision, 50 years ago, of a society protected by a national system of social insurance has never been realized and, instead, social assistance, designed as a residual and diminishing means of support, has gradually expanded to make up for the inadequacies of a national insurance system which was at first neglected, then attacked by governments. This important shift in the founding principles of the British income maintenance programme occurred without any public or parliamentary debate and without public acknowledgement by government that it was happening. As a result, British social assistance provision has continually been stretched beyond reasonable limits.

But the idea of providing an unconditional basic income to every individual, rich or poor, active or inactive, has been advocated by such major thinkers as Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill, and John Kenneth Galbraith. For a long time, it was hardly noticed and never taken seriously. Today, with the traditional welfare state creaking under pressure, it has become one of the most widely debated social policy proposals in the world. Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght present the most comprehensive defense of this radical idea so far, advocating it as our most realistic hope for addressing economic insecurity and social exclusion in the twenty-first century. The authors seamlessly combine philosophy, politics, and economics as they compare the idea of a basic income with rival ideas past and present for guarding against poverty and unemployment. They trace its history, tackle the economic and ethical objections against an unconditional income--including its alleged tendency to sap incentives and foster free riding--and lay out how such an apparently implausible idea might be viable financially and achievable politically. Finally, they consider the relevance of the proposal in an increasingly globalized economy.

Here, we present three studies carried out during 2020 in UK and US samples. In study 1 ( n = 802, April 2020), people expressed much stronger support for a UBI policy for the times of the pandemic and its aftermath than for normal times. This was largely explained by the increased importance they attached, in the pandemic context, to a system that is simple and efficient to administer, and that reduces stress and anxiety in society. In study 2 ( n = 400, May 2020), we pitted UBI against a conditional targeted social transfer system. Preferences for UBI were stronger for pandemic times than for normal times. This was partially explained by a number of perceived advantages, such as simplicity of administration and suitability for a changing world. In study 3 ( n = 397, September 2020), we found that the headline results of studies 1 and 2 persisted six months after the onset of the pandemic, albeit with attenuated effect sizes.

Growth takes place in terms of monetary flows, financial assets and transactions, capital accumulation; in terms of aggregate material throughput, infrastructure, desires, efficiency and productivity. It is equally promoted by those who call for austerity as well as those who advocate Keynesianism. The final result is often the same. Problems are shifted in space and time. The growth fetish, however, will not go away by ignoring it, but by creating the necessary political, social and economic conditions for managing and living well without growth. Degrowth, unlike what the term may suggest to the uninitiated, is not a technical economic term, meaning the opposite of growth. While it denounces GDP growth, its focus lies on changing the context and the units of measurement, or reference. The thorny goal of reducing consumption within degrowth is driven by principles of political organization in the spirit of caring for the commons, voluntary simplicity, and conviviality. Our hypothesis is that there is little to lose from embarking on a degrowth trajectory. On the contrary, only by dropping the growth fetish (now) can emissions be stabilized and extreme events prevented from menacing livelihoods. We empirically demonstrate here that the discomforts associated with living in a state of climatic instability cannot be offset by monetary growth.

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has set up a working group to examine its implications, and four Scottish councils are hoping to launch pilot schemes. Contemporary British interest in UBI forms part of a lively global debate about automation, inequality and precarious labour, but it also draws on a long history of proposals for tax-benefit reform within UK social policy. This article identifies five waves of enthusiasm for basic income in Britain over the past century and highlights patterns of continuity and change. It shows that interest in the proposal has been greatest at times of pessimism about the future of the labour market, though concerns about the ethics and affordability of unconditional payments have always been difficult to shake. Advocates of UBI have also struggled to reconcile the technocratic approach of its Conservative and Liberal supporters with the transformative ambitions of the radical left. It remains to be seen whether the recent growth of left-wing support for UBI will improve its prospects of implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279417000800,"Universal Basic Income in British Politics, 1918–2018: From a ‘Vagabond's Wage’ to a Global Debate"

6.8674912,15.54631,4,"Welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996, which created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, makes entitlement to federal poor relief conditional on fulfilling work requirements. The article addresses the following timely question: whether just liberal societies should require work as a condition of public assistance for the able-bodied, or whether aid should be provided unconditionally through, for example, a basic guaranteed income for all. Drawing on the work of liberal egalitarian theorists, the article investigates whether standard liberal theories of justice can help make sense of arguments commonly voiced in favor of work requirements: that unconditional welfare guarantees, such as a universal basic income, exploit workers, license free riding, and violate basic principles of social reciprocity. The article concludes that the view that unconditional benefits are unfair or exploitative is difficult to derive from liberal notions of just societies. Liberal egalitarians start from a baseline of equal initial shares of resources, skepticism about desert and market allocations, and an obligation to hold persons harmless for unlucky outcomes and endowments that does not clearly yield a bedrock obligation to work for a living. Drawing on an evolutionary analysis, the article concludes that any tension between liberal theories and politically popular notions of fairness are due to the failure of political theory to capture dynamic historical conditions that gave rise to basic norms against shirking. The logic of evolutionary development is fundamentally at odds with the static, contractarian thought experiments that liberal theorists favor. The article speculates on the implications of this explanation for the divergence between principles derived from rational analysis and the realities of political psychology.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.316579,Something for Nothing: Liberal Justice and Welfare Work Requirements

41.760426,-6.863506,4,"Visiting the main employment office in Warsaw in late 1989, I asked how many people they were currently paying benefits to. The answer (in a city of 1.6 million people) was five. A year later, unemployment in Poland was more than a million, and by December 1993 was three million. There is no need to belabour the resulting strains on a social safety net designed for a very different regime. This paper discusses how the safety nets in the reforming countries, though in many ways well-adapted to the old system, were poorly suited to the needs of a market economy, and what progress has been made in adjusting them. The problems faced by the system of income transfers need to be seen against the backdrop of broader constraints facing policy makers at the start of the reforms. The emphasis on these constraints is not intended to sound gloomy; rather the opposite – it shows how much progress has been made in very difficult circumstances. A former French Prime Minister invited fellow citizens to imagine that France had over a very few years to go through the Political Revolution of 1789, the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the decolonisation of the 1960’s. That, he pointed out, was precisely what the world community is asking Russia to achieve.",https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02430938,Income transfers in transition : constraints and progress

A recent narrative, endorsed by prominent tech-billionaires, says we face mass unemployment, and we need a basic income. In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is an entirely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment, and it can be done again. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Taking lessons from history, it is clear that unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy. To uphold human rights, governments should reprogramme the law, for full employment, fair incomes and reduced working time, on a living planet.

This interest is also true for EU member states but it has not led to coordinated actions in the past. The Commission denied the necessity of harmonizing corporate income taxation when the proposals of the Ruding Report 2 were discussed in the early 1990s. One reason was certainly the EC Treaty which although fundamentally revised and extended by the European Single Act and the Treaty of Maastricht only addresses the harmonization of commodity taxes. There have, however, been agreements and EU directives concerning the abolition of income tax discrimination for transborder capital flows (merger directive, parent subsidiary directive), improved transborder cooperation of tax authorities (administrative assistance, arbitration convention), or harmful tax practices (code on conduct on business taxation). Objectives behind these measures have been competitiveness in the internal market and administrative issues rather than revenue and tax policy targets. The Bolkestein report 3 marked a change in the EU’s position towards capital taxation by stressing the importance of supranational coordination of capital taxation. Most member countries seem to subscribe to the necessity for stronger capital income tax coordination, but little if any progress can be identified. Governments are very reluctant and unwilling to shift competences in capital income taxation to the EU, because this is recognized to have major fiscal repercussions on national income taxation and national tax revenue. To overcome this standstill Sijbren Cnossen recently proposed an agenda for capital income tax coordination in the EU, which in his view should pave the way to broader political support. The paper is organized as follows. The Cnossen agenda, which calls for the introduction of a dual income tax (DIT) in EU member countries as a first step, is presented in section 2.",,Dual Income Taxation as a Stepping Stone Towards a European Corporate Income Tax

It is the nature of these guarantees that represents the sharp division in policy recommendations. Income guarantee supporters champion the provision of an adequate standard of living by affording sufficient resources to all member of society. They argue that this objective can be achieved by guaranteeing a minimum income to all (a basic income guarantee, or BIG). Job creation proponents want to use an Employer of Last Resort (ELR) program to guarantee access to a job that could provide a minimum income to the economically active population. The key distinction between the two is that basic income advocates want to decouple the income-work relationship observed in modern economies, on the basis that economic justice and freedom require that resources be provided to individuals without the compulsion to work. Job guarantee supporters, on the other hand, want to address the unemployment problem, arguing that there are many people who want to work but cannot find employment.This paper advances two arguments: first, that basic income guarantees are unlikely to achieve the objectives of alleviating poverty, income inequality, or poor standards of living, because the proposals have an inherent highly inflationary bias that would have disastrous consequences for the currency; second, that certain direct job creation programs such as ELR achieve most of the common goals that income and job guarantee supporters share, without introducing the crucial problem of inflation. ELR programs can be designed so that they are not coercive or demeaning. Neither should they be means tested. An ELR program is neither slavery nor unemployment by another name. We agree with BIG proponents that basic income is needed for those who are too young, old, or ill to work and that a less generous form of BIG would not necessarily cause high inflation. However, we believe that the BIG idea of guaranteeing a decent standard of living by mailing a check sufficient to purchase that standard of living to all Americans will cause high inflation, if not hyperinflation, and reduce the incentive to work.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1009629,Can Basic Income and Job Guarantees Deliver on Their Promises?

The Failed Welfare Revolution shows us that things might have turned out differently. During the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers in three presidential administrations tried to replace the nation's existing welfare system with a revolutionary program to guarantee Americans basic economic security. Surprisingly from today's vantage point, guaranteed income plans received broad bipartisan support in the 1960s. One proposal, President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan, nearly passed into law in the 1970s, and President Carter advanced a similar bill a few years later. The failure of these proposals marked the federal government's last direct effort to alleviate poverty among the least advantaged and, ironically, sowed the seeds of conservative welfare reform strategies under President Reagan and beyond. This episode has largely vanished from America's collective memory. Here, Brian Steensland tells the whole story for the first time--from why such an unlikely policy idea first developed to the factors that sealed its fate. His account, based on extensive original research in presidential archives, draws on mainstream social science perspectives that emphasize the influence of powerful stakeholder groups and policymaking institutions.

-24.060184,-18.01381,2,"Is a social investment strategy compatible with the provision of an unconditional basic income? Prima facie, these two scenarios look like incongruent policy alternatives. While social investment – an influential policy paradigm at the level of the European Union – aims at promoting public services and maximum labour market participation, basic income is paid in cash and has sometimes been presented as the key component of a post-work future. In this article, we explore this apparent incongruence and show that these two visions for welfare reform are not necessarily incompatible. We argue that they may share a number of substantial points of agreement, and indeed may reinforce one another according to a logic of institutional complementarity. In particular, we claim that a partial basic income (i.e., a modest unconditional income guarantee, whose amount would be insufficient if one lives alone) could enhance or complement the key functions of a social-democratic version of the social investment strategy. By doing so, we conclude that the integration of a basic income into a social investment package could contribute to overcoming criticisms of the social investment agenda. At the same time, it could rescue basic income from the numerous critics who see it as an unrealistic policy proposal.",https://doi.org/10.1177/13882627221085019,Basic Income and the Social Investment State: Towards Mutual Reinforcement?
24.732756,10.216297,4,"In this paper, I attempt to clarify the ideas of equality underlying section 15   for benefits such as welfare and health care; I use the name   rights claims for these types of claims. I adopt Joseph Raz's division of equality   into rhetorical egalitarian claims, which are based in a failure to equally respect a universal claim (and typically take a form such as, All Fs have a right to G), and strict egalitarian claims, which are based on an actually existing unequal distribution of resources (and take the form, All Fs who do not have G have a right to G if some Fs have G). I show how the dignity-based approach to equality stemming from Law v. Canada is an example of a rhetorical egalitarian claim. With this groundwork set, I turn my attention to the economic rights claims. I survey three reasons for thinking that an unequal distribution of some benefit might, even absent any failure to respect or recognize the dignity of those at the losing end, be thought of as wrong or unjust. The first two reasons - an appeal to an idea of sufficiency, and the fear that some stigma might be associated with the inequality - I reject in favour of the third, which is that in a situation in which all the participants have some equal claim to a benefit, a fair procedure will result in their benefiting equally. Following John Rawls, I suggest that our society, as a cooperative venture for mutual advantage, creates in its members at least a prima facie equal claim to share in the society's benefits. The economic rights claims, then, are   that this prima facie equal claim has not been respected. But the benefits being claimed for, as benefits created by the society, are not benefits automatically due to everyone just in virtue of their humanity, instead they are due to the worst-off once the best off have come to be able to benefit from them. Thus they take a strict egalitarian form - once some members of our society benefit in a certain way, then the equality of all members as contributors to the cooperative venture for mutual advantage implies that the other members of our society gain a claim to that benefit. The fact that these economic rights   are strict egalitarian   means they cannot be grounded in arguments about dignity, as dignity-based   are rhetorical egalitarian   for benefits due to all in virtue of their universal human dignity. I conclude by returning to Law to highlight a passage which I believe provides a grounding for a recognition of economic rights in line with my argument; I also make some brief comments on the need for a stricter division of labour between section 15 and section 1 in the context of economic rights   and on the effect of this argument on Canadian federal law more generally.",,"Dignity and Membership, Equality and Egalitarianism: Economic Rights and Section 15"

It could be financed by an EU flat tax of 0.2% on all household income, assuming that it would also be taxed nationally as income. Most member states and virtually all families with children aged under 6 would be net gainers. We simulate two versions of EU CBI, with the benefit rate of â‚¬50 per month adjusted or not for differences in purchasing power between member states. In general, fiscal flows between member states, and also poverty reduction, would be smaller under the adjusted version.

In this paper I first discuss the poverty concept and its implication for social policy strategy. The poverty concept should be but one in a system of concepts that throws light on the whole distribution of income and wealth and how income from labor as well as income from capital is generated. The central concepts in the system are income and economic standard, which I explain in different perspectives on command over resources. The command-over-resources concept is used to get from a narrow concept of material welfare that can be measured in money to a wider concept of welfare that includes the universal common social concerns. I confess to being intrigued by the fact that a list of social concerns can be agreed upon that seems to be relevant across cultures, political systems and times. I suggest that this surmised universality springs from the great “life projects” that all humans face over the life cycle. I then discuss the role of social indicators and social reporting as continuous information on these common concerns in the context of an epistemology of the democratic process. Social reporting would serve the democratic process best if it answers “how it is” and leaves the answers on “how it ought to be” and “what should be done” to come about through discussion among citizens.",,Conceptualizing and Measuring Quality of Life for National Policy

A feature of advanced economies that distinguishes them from developing countries is the existence of well developed, if often incomplete, safety nets. We develop a framework for describing transfer programs, flexible enough to encompass most existing programs as well as UBIs, and use this framework to compare various UBIs to the existing constellation of programs in the United States. A UBI would direct much larger shares of transfers to childless, non-elderly, non-disabled households than existing programs, and much more to middle-income rather than poor households. A UBI large enough to increase transfers to low-income families would be enormously expensive. We review the labor supply literature for evidence on the likely impacts of a UBI.

This paradigm shift may represent a challenge for today’s model of social state based on the work ethic.

The discussion is based upon neoclassical labor supply and migration theory and informed by the conjectured economic effects from a normative perspective. This research suggests that a basic income would create migration incentives that reduce the tax base, leading us to question this policy’s feasibility. Moreover, the flow-on effects of migration call into question the justice of both residence-based and citizenship-based basic income schemes.

Regarding strategic feasibility, advocates of the universal basic income do not form a powerful discrete group. Instead, they form a diffuse group that lacks the political power and organisation to translate their advocacy into a powerful social action.

Regarding psychological feasibility, popular support for basic income depends on how we measure it and that the relatively cheap popular support that it enjoys is not strong enough to make significant changes to the prevailing discourse on social policy. Finally, in terms of behavioural feasibility, the experiment did not produce effects on employment - or at least not to a significant level - to convince decision-makers. However, universal basic income may improve recipients’ feelings of freedom, dignity, and self-determination. The conclusion is that there are serious obstacles to the political feasibility of basic income in Finland. However, the COVID-19 pandemic had neither increased nor intensified political discussions on the implementation of basic income in Finland, as it has done in many other countries.",https://doi.org/10.4337/9781839104855.00022,The feasibility of universal basic income

This chapter concludes that when lowered work ability forms a barrier to employment, the provision of unconditional social benefits such as basic income does not enhance employment. We argue that services are needed to enhance re-employment possibilities and further activation of citizens. As such, income transfers must be accompanied by a wide array of services to improve the employability of those who have multiple barriers to employment. In Finland, public employment services offer other services to unemployed jobseekers, such as municipal health, social services, and educational services. The provision of these services place an emphasis on the transition toward a more intensified multidisciplinary work in a customer-oriented manner.

Through an assessment of the ideas of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, it argues that basic income is one of the few policy solutions in the mainstream discourse that improves social welfare and income security, while also remaining consistent with neoliberalism’s inner logic. Accordingly, it holds the potential to temporarily stabilize neoliberalism’s political crisis by offering a consensus issue around which a new centrist coalition could emerge. Although much of the basic income literature has focused on grassroots coalitions and synergies between left and right, it has largely overlooked the emergence of the historical forces that have pushed it onto the mainstream policy agenda.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279421000763,Basic Income and the Legitimization Crisis of Neoliberalism
36.84182,6.1057715,4,"In 1960, Ronald H. Coase famously addressed the problem of externalities - actions of business firms that have harmful effects on others - or, as he renamed it, “the problem of social cost.” This problem occurs under every joint   activity (including business firms) having reciprocal consequences on its stakeholders. This Article seeks to address the underlying   coordination problem through a comparative analysis of the alternative institutional solutions of ownership, market, taxation, responsibility, and the accounting system of the joint entity. Each prospective solution carries a distinct strategy. The ownership solution involves the allocation, by law, of control rights that individuals can bargain for. The market solution, in contrast, involves the allocation of that right through a competitive auction. Taxation requires the establishment of a public order concerned with the power to fix and raise taxes, whereas the responsibility solution involves the enforcement of a compensation claim or liability for tort damages. Finally, the entity solution consists of a joint system of governance that is characterized by an accounting system of the joint activity under scrutiny.Coase claims that the delimitation of property rights is, in and of itself, sufficient to achieve social welfare. But Coase bases this claim on an efficiency criterion that looks solely to the sum of individual welfares, without regard to the possibility of inequitable results. His approach confounds notions of social cost, incurred loss, and lost opportunity gain, and faces distinctive accounting problems with individual availability and capacity to pay, along with the incommensurability of values. This Article takes a different approach. It introduces a “systemic efficiency” or economic fairness criterion based on welfare ranges for individuals in addition to the total sum. Using this criterion, this Article argues that, by requiring explicit income-sharing and joint-decision instrumentalities, the entity solution is the most efficient and equitable solution to the social cost problem.",,The Problem of Social Income: The Entity View of the Cathedral

Member States increased their per capita spending on social protection in real terms by 40.6 per cent between 1980 and 1992 (EUROSTAT, 1994). Nevertheless, the extent of social exclusion has continued to widen. Many women are dependent upon social protection payments. This article examines, therefore, the European intervention in the domain of social exclusion and considers whether the intervention alters the gender bias that exists within the social protection systems of the Member States. Analysing the concept of equal treatment beyond Article 119 and its related directives reveals that the legislation applicable to social exclusion does not prevent Member States, in their creation of social rights, from eroding the civil right of equal treatment: Recommendation 92/441 was virtually nullified by being based on Article 235 and this step resulted in the social right to sufficient resources existing in soft-law; Article 123 Structural Fund money was spent in ways that have entailed that women do indeed continue to face social exclusion; and the recent reforms to the structural funds have resulted in Germany blocking the approval of the Poverty 4 programme combating social exclusion.

This paper builds on the results contained in a previous EUROMOD working paper by proposing two financially feasible ways of implementing a Citizenâ€™s Income. The first method would be an â€˜all at onceâ€™ method. That is, it would establish a small Citizenâ€™s Income for every citizen of the UK, of whatever age. This paper shows that a strictly revenue neutral scheme is available that could be paid for by raising Income Tax rates by 3%, by abolishing Income Tax Personal Allowances, and by making adjustments to National Insurance Contributions. This scheme would impose almost no household disposable income losses on low income households at the point of implementation, and manageable losses on households in general. A second method â€“ a â€˜one step at a timeâ€™ method - would turn Child Benefit into a Child Citizenâ€™s Income, then establish a Young adult Citizenâ€™s Income, and then enable those in receipt of the Young adult Citizenâ€™s Income to keep their Citizenâ€™s Incomes as they grow older.

Many AIDS service organizations (ASO) help the people they serve to establish small enterprises so that they may generate much needed income.   For example enterprising women can earn income without resorting to prostitution.   Other microenterprises can help support people impoverished by illness.   This article explains that while some businesses launched through these income generation projects succeed many fail because of poor planning a lack of relevant skills and knowledge inadequate analysis of prevailing economic opportunities and competition narrow perceptions of possible undertakings confusion between viability and other goals a lack of awareness of the time and resources needed and difficulties in handling initial success.   ASOs do not always select suitable activities and develop them in a serious business-like manner.   Most failures could however be avoided if ASOs drew upon the experience of groups already involved in poverty alleviation and womens development over the years.   It is recommended that before embarking upon income generation ASOs consider other ways of providing material support; ASOs must be clear whether the small business is expected to become a viable and independent enterprise or whether it will require ongoing external assistance; only appropriate activities must be chosen; and when ASOs do establish income-generating enterprises they must be sure to organize adequate training in finance marketing administration and management skills.   Case histories from Zimbabwe are presented to illustrate what can go wrong when these recommendations are not followed.,,Income generation: a note of caution.

However, most politicians of Sweden show little interest, some even offense, towards an idea suggesting an income connected to citizenship rather than work. This bachelor thesis aims to define the concept of basic income, and examine how the idea of welfare without demand has emerged as an alternative to dominating ideas in relation to matters of the welfare state. It also aims to relate these ideas to actual projects concerning basic income and resembling examples around the globe and finally identify expected effects of those projects and examples. This study of economic history shows that ideas about basic income is traceable within all three ideologies examined: social liberalism, classic liberalism and socialism. Social liberals debated matters of “basic capital” and “minimum guarantee” during the 1800s. The idea was presented to the public in conjunction with classic liberal theories regarding negative income tax during the 1960s. Within socialism, joint ownership was always part of the ideological foundation, nevertheless there are no political proposals concerning basic income in the history of socialist thought, basically due to a close connection between welfare and labour. Eight examples of projects and permanent economic solutions similar to basic income are presented in this paper, as are expected and actual effects of those projects. The study shows that there are no, nor has there been, any real basic income that is guaranteed, individual, without demand and at the same time enough for basic support of living.

However, the four sucessive Conservative governments of 1979 to 1997 brought a fundamental change in approach. Rejecting Beveridge’s idea that the state should provide financial assistance ‘from the cradle to the grave’ to those deemed to be in need, reforms were directed towards reducing the role of the state in providing financial support to those in need. This manifested itself in a number of ways. Most obviously, from 1980 benefits were uprated in line with prices rather than with wages, the consequence of which was that benefit levels fell sharply in comparison to the standard of living enjoyed by those not having to resort to state support, e.g. between 1978 and 1987 a married couple’s normal entitlement to supplementary benefit fell from 61% of personal disposable income per capita to 53%. Secondly, increased conditions were imposed on eligibility for entitlement to benefits. Thus, as an example, in 1989 the requirement to be ‘actively seeking work’ was added to that of being ‘available for work’ for those claiming unemployment benefit while, when jobseeker’s allowance replaced unemployment benefit in 1996, a further requirement of needing to agree a ‘jobseeker’s agreement’ was also imposed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-14610-9_14,Reform — Past and Present

While a universal Justice may exist in theory, in reality 'Justice' is replaced by cultural bound 'justices,' particularistic and contextual, rooted in the societies which they shape and which, in turn, shape them. Similarly, there is no universal Truth in taxation. A tax is just or fair only for a particular society and only to the extent that it supports and furthers the normative goals of that society. As a consequence, this Article takes a particularistic approach to distributive justice and taxation. Part I of this Article summarizes various formal theories of justice and of income taxation. Part II explores the nature of the American perception of justice. First, it provides an overview of the two political concepts that have shaped our country: liberty and equality. It then summarizes the American tradition, which I have labeled 'moral economic individualism,' that articulates the meanings of liberty and equality that resonate most strongly within our national psyche. Part III surveys empirical evidence of American beliefs about distributive justice and taxation.

To correct this imbalance and to throw light on the problems of winning political support for BI, this article considers whether BI is viable. At this stage, the exercise is necessarily speculative, but can be useful as long as care is taken to specify institutional arrangements and to take into account the way social agents are likely to respond to the introduction of BI. Accordingly, I develop a theoretical model of the interaction between tax-transfer policy and economic performance to explore the options facing the citizens of an imaginary state, who are contemplating radical reform but espouse divergent moral values. Initially, to fix ideas, I assume that their options are independent of the prevailing normative climate. In the end, however, I show that this assumption is untenable, and I draw conclusions for BI as a political project.",https://doi.org/10.2202/1932-0183.1079,Is Basic Income Viable?

In this situation, the individual loses her/his most precious capacity: the ability to make a living through her or his own initiative and work.

33.82304,11.454204,4,"Democratic Distributive Justice by Ross Zucker In Democratic Distributive Justice, Ross Zucker (2000)1 argues that a capitalist economic system constitutes a community of agents with certain common aims; that the individuals who comprise this community contribute through their interdependent activity to the promotion of those shared aims; and that the intrinsically interdependent character of most economic activity establishes a principle of distributive justice which entitles every participant in the economy to an equal share of a part of the income and wealth created by that activity. According to Zucker, the principal common aim of all agents is the preservation and expansion of capital; for all income originates in an expanding circuit of money and production. Interruption of that circuit damages workers and capitalists, consumers and sellers, alike. The perpetuation of this circuit depends in large part on socially organic activities. First, production is by its nature collaborative and grounded in intersectoral linkages. Second, no production process can continue unless there are buyers for what that process creates. Third, consumption patterns are themselves socially formed. And, fourth, so are the work habits upon which efficient production depends. The social character of the circuit of capital, Zucker contends, justifies egalitarianism in the distribution of part of the aggregate income. His argument can be read as an answer to Margaret Thatcher's famous remark, in a 1987 interview, that ""there is no such thing as society. There are [only] individual[s] . . . and . . . families."" Zucker's argument is novel and carefully developed. It is also extremely topical. Over the past two decades income and wealth inequality in the US have gone through the roof (see Bernstein, Mishel & Brocht, 2000). A similar, though less pronounced, trend is evident in Western Europe, where economic policy discussions center on whether, or how quickly, the allegedly more efficient American model should be imported. The same issues have arisen in connection with the transition to capitalism of the economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Recent financial scandals in the US have cast a discomfiting light on the ethical ramifications of exploding inequality, and some observers have begun to worry that the re-emergence of Gilded Age disparities in economic well-being will have profoundly destabilizing social consequences (see Krugman, 2002). Economists are notoriously self-conscious about the scientific pedigree of their discipline. Most of us would rather talk about efficiency than about justice, and questions of distributive justice concern precisely the sort of normative issues that economists prefer to avoid. The conventional neo-liberal wisdom maintains that there is a trade-off between efficiency and equality—that the latter can be enhanced only at the expense of the former. But this view is a distortion of the orthodox neoclassical position, which is agnostic on the desirability of alternative distributive regimes. Indeed the reluctance of orthodox economics to engage the problem of distributive justice is reflected in the ultimately vacuous criterion by which it evaluates economic outcomes—Pareto optimality. A particular allocation of resources is said to be Pareto optimal if no agent's well-being can be improved without reducing the well-being of some other agent. Leaving aside the fact that the conditions required to generate Pareto optimal outcomes are so restrictive that they can never obtain in actual market economies, the Pareto criterion is an extremely weak prescriptive device. It says only what is obvious: that if resources can be reallocated so as to make someone better off without causing harm to anyone else, such a reallocation is desirable. The criterion does not even allow us to say that a Pareto optimal allocation is always superior to a position that is not Pareto optimal.2 It dodges entirely the problem of how we ought to proceed when the well-being of some agents can be improved only at the cost of diminishing the well-being of others, that is, the problem of redistribution. Neoclassical theory does contend that market outcomes are by-and-large efficient (pace the standard caveats about...",https://doi.org/10.1353/gso.2004.0030,Distributive Justice: An Economist's Perspective

It introduced the new unemployment benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld II) as a major element and final stage of a series of labour market reforms termed the Hartz reforms which aimed at flexibilization of the German labour market and granted (re)integration of persons in need into the labour market precedence over pure economic subsidies. The new means tested benefit integrated the former social assistance (a welfare benefit) and the former unemployment assistance for long-term unemployed persons whose entitlement to unemployment insurance payments had expired. Its paradigm is summarized in the slogan “support and challenge” (in German “fordern und fordern”). Support for integration into employment was extended to groups that had formerly been far detached from the labour market. On the other hand status protection regulations were disestablished and pressure on recipients to take up any reasonable employment was increased by the introduction of benefit sanctions and active labour market programmes designed to test work motivation.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12651-013-0149-7,Journal for labour market research: special issue PASS

3.9591675,-8.109251,0,"Social security programmes may be divided into two broad groups of pro grammes, those concerned with income security and those concerned with op portunity security. Income security programmes may be further divided into positive transfer programmes, where there is a cash flow from the government to the individual, and negative transfer programmes, which are a component of the taxation system. Positive transfer programmes may be universal or limited, the main limitation being benefits subject to a means test. Positive transfer programmes may also be classified as to whether they are income based measures, distinguish- . ing between income replacement and income supplement programmes; or whether they are expenditure based, whereby the beneficiary receives either full or partial campensation for expenditure he has made or is assumed to have made. The philosophy lying behind income security programmes may be related to the principle of either individual need or social right. The former principle tends to be associated with programmes which are limited in nature while universal programmes tend to be based on the principle of social right. In the past most of the income security programmes in Australia have been based on the principle of individual need, but since 1972 there has been a marked shift to programmes based on social right, particularly the policy of abolishing the means test on aged pensions and the introduction of Medibank. Social right policies, in general, tend to be more costly and alleviate less need per dollar of outlay than individual need programmes. Apart from the move towards social right programmes, there has been an increasing lack of coordination between existing and proposed programmes. Although an inter-departmental committee has been established to investigate this problem, it is unlikely that any real change will eventuate from that source in the near future. What is required in Australia today is not further studies of poverty or the prescription of new programmes, but an explicit statement of social welfare philosophy on which programmes are to be based, and the establishment of an organisation whose primary and perhaps sole task is to co-ordinate social security programmes. 1. J. Cutt, New perspectives on welfare reform, Social Security Quarterly, 1973-74 (3), 1. 2. A universal scheme is one applicable to what is known in statistics as the 'population', which is the number of individuals with the specified characteristics. In this sense, the 'population' does not mean all individuals in the nation. 3. See Compensation and Rehabilitation in Australia, Report of the National Committee of Inquiry, Canberra: Australian Gov ernment Printer, 1974. On the other hand the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry did not come down in favour of either kind of benefits scheme. See National Superannuation in Australia, Interim Report of the National Super annuation Committee of Inquiry, Canberra : Australian Government Printer, 1974, p. 20 and Chapter 9. 4. The distinction between an income supplement programme and an expenditure based programme is somewhat arbitrary in that income supplement programmes are also inherently designed to provide additional funds to the individual to offset assumed higher expenditure because of prescribed circumstances (for example having children under 16 years of age). In this paper the distinction is based on the degree of regularity of the payment. Continuing payments are classified as income supplements, while once-for-all payments are classified as expenditure based. Of course, an individual may receive more than a single such payment during the year, the number depending on the occurrence of the event which generates the expenditure — visits to a doctor, confinements. 5.

It must be admitted that concern about lack of coordination existed within the labour government. It existed in 1972 because the need for coordination was inherent in the functions given to the Social Welfare Commission when it was later establish ed. The fact that the Commission did nothing about coordinating anything reflects not only its own failing but also to a large extent the lack of willingness of a departmentalized structure of administration and its ministers to be coordinated, a lack illustrated by the subsequent establishment of another coordinating review body. This ludicrous position was heigh tened by the submission of numerous reports to the government on welfare matters, all of which represented individual assessments of the nation's ills and prescriptions for their alleviation. In 1975 it was decided to appoint an interdepart mental committee to report on coordination, and presumably to indicate how this can be achieved. Little can be expected from this because the real solution is the necessity to reform the structure of government by converting its existing depart mental structure into a functional structure, with a significantly smaller number of separate functions than the number of existing departments. Hence it is likely that this IDC will conform to the definition given to that term by outsiders—an Inter-Departmental Confrontation designed to Create Intense Delaying Camouflage as justification for the absence of Intel lectually Demanding Consideration of the need for Integrated Dynamic Change.",https://doi.org/10.1177/002087287702000105,Income Security Programmes and the Philosophy of Social Security Policy

Progressive taxes on income and wealth are then justified for the aim and in the height as it is necessary to eliminate or at least alleviate poverty.

In this paper we explore the feasibility, the desirability and the features of a universal policy of minimum income in Italy. We use a microeconometric model and a social welfare methodology in order to evaluate various alternatives mechanisms. We simulate the effects and the social welfare performance of 30 reforms resulting from six versions of five basic types of income support mechanism: guaranteed minimum income (GMI), universal basic income (UBI), wage subsidy (WS) and two mixed systems: GMI+WS and UBI+WS. As welfare evaluation criteria we adopt the Gini Social Welfare function and the Poverty-Adjusted Gini Social Welfare function. All the reforms are calibrated so as to preserve fiscal neutrality. The simulation adopts a methodology that allows for market equilibrium and ensures a consistent comparative statics interpretation of the results. Universal and non mean-tested transfers (possibly complemented by wage subsidy) emerge as desirable and feasible features of the income support mechanism. In the most realistic scenarios, the social-welfare-optimal policies are an unconditional transfer combined with a wage subsidy (a total benefit amounting to about 70% of the poverty level) or – depending on the social welfare criterion – a more generous pure unconditional transfer amounting to100% of the poverty level. In this exercise the reforms can be financed by proportionally increasing the current marginal tax rates and widening the tax base to include all personal incomes, with top marginal rates close to ones currently applied in the Scandinavian countries. The set of universalistic policies that are preferable to the current system is anyway very large and appears to give the opportunity of selecting a best reform according to many different criteria or constraints.",,Designing a universal income support mechanism for Italy.An exploratory tour

The nature and extent of atypical employment has been a critical factor because of its dimension on diminishing the realization of human rights in the workplace. The resultant thereto is burgeoning precarious work, which deprives workers access to their fundamental social necessities associated with decent work. It is revealed that indubitably, atypical work is associated with declining living standards, persistent poverty, societal socio-economic inequalities, diminishing job security and lack of social protection. Thus, it is considered a human rights issue which can best be addressed using the law in the Constitution, 1996 and fundamental international instruments. It is asserted that essential labour legislation should be reformulated to enable it to be responsive in restoring and sustaining its purpose of protecting workers labour rights, and safeguarding their social security in the modern world of work. This is essential for labour peace and social justice, because labour law ought to resonate with the transformative ideals of the Constitution.

It also refers to the results of this campaign in the following years, highlighting not only its direct impact but also its indirect consequences in the medium term, in particular on the public debates related to the social policies implemented by the new centre–left government since 2003. This campaign, popularly known as FRENAPO (National Front Against Poverty), was organised in the context of the implementation of neo-liberal macroeconomic policies in Argentina, which led the country to the biggest crisis in its history at the end of 2001. The members of the campaign proposed a package of economic and social measures oriented to unemployed workers (a basic income grant plus a professional education scheme), to the children and to the elderly (a basic income grant for both). The proposal was supported in a referendum by more than three million people all over the country during December 2001, but it was not considered by the Parliament. Although the alliance that supported FRENAPO eventually crumbled, the campaign was successful in its objective of influencing the public debates on how to respond to poverty and extreme poverty. Several measures implemented by the new centre–left government since 2003 were inspired by those debates, particularly those aimed at guaranteeing an income for children and the elderly. This article analyses the context of the campaign, identifies its concrete goals, origins and members, and explains how FRENAPO built power in order to achieve those objectives.

The unconditional basic income in the form of a negative income tax is therefore discussed and tentatively developed. It is suggested that the negative income tax should be granted unconditionally and individually to all legal and permanent residents without the obligation of services in return. Besides the negative lump sum tax, a lump sum supplement should be granted for caregivers, honorary workers and people incapable of working. Based on a person’s own income a positive tax should be counted against the negative income tax. With the implementation of the suggested model of a negative income tax, basic (financial) needs could be secured and the tax and transfer system could be harmonized, whereby administration effort could be reduced and poverty traps avoided. It is stressed that for the implementation of a comprehensive model of a negative income tax all relevant parameters as well as possible impacts need to be investigated cautiously; suggestions of this thesis therefore need to be seen as a first attempt.

14.920624,23.281603,4,"This article contributes to the debate on automation and justice by discussing two under-represented concerns: labour justice and equality. Since automation involves both winners and losers, and given that there is no ‘end of work’ on the horizon, it is argued that most normative views on the subject – i.e. the ‘allocative’ view of basic income, and the ‘desirability’ views of post-work and workist ethics – do not provide many resources with which to address unjustly unequal divisions of labour involved in technological innovation. This article problematises these common responses reframing the problem from the perspective of labour justice. While the allocative view assumes that labour justice follows ‘spontaneously’ from income redistribution, the desirability views are chiefly interested in either defining or contesting the meanings of work for individuals, overlooking the interdependent nature of work and concerns of equality other than autonomy. Two conceptions of labour justice are thus applied to the problem: Paul Gomberg’s contributive justice, and Iris Young’s democratic division of labour. Instead of deciding between them, the normative core of ‘contributive parity’ is suggested as a critical standard for assessing unequal labour structures, and for envisaging a future in which technology can be an ally in making social cooperation fair.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17496535.2018.1512141,"Automation, Labour Justice, and Equality"

The main contribution of my thesis is to question this view. I make progress to existing literature by taking time series persistence and simultaneity issues in the data into account. Formal tests are established, and they suggest that both problems are present. I therefore first difference the data and use an instrument variable approach during estimation. The econometric framework provides a couple of interesting results. First, once time series persistence is accounted for, the estimated effect of income on democracy changes from positive to negative and statistically significant. Second, when economic growth is instrumented the point estimate drops even further, making it quantitatively important as well.

-31.785154,17.708029,2,"The Haig-Simons concept of income has for roughly fifty years been a gold standard of income tax theory and policy discussion. This article argues that the classic Haig-Simons formulation of personal income, which consists of an individual’s consumption plus net increases in wealth for the taxable year, could not be maintained by Simons himself, is contrary to fundamental political values, is unnecessary, and is inferior to an objective ability-to-pay realization personal income tax. Specifically, the Haig-Simons concept simply gets it wrong insofar as it posits that consumption is an independent category of income. That leaves “consumption” as a deduction-disallowance principle, but in that respect the concept is ambiguous and insufficient. Finally, the notion of “changes in wealth” hasn’t made headway, due to the persistence of the realization principle. The problems attending the Haig-Simons income concept, as well as Simons’ goal of designing a redistributive tax, are resolved under an objective ability-to-pay personal income concept. Part I uncovers the basic ambiguity as to the role of “consumption” under the Haig-Simons concept of income, and demonstrates that consumption under the Haig-Simons concept should not be interpreted as a gross income principle. Thus, imputed income (and other intangible benefits received) are not properly viewed as gross income in the tax sense. Instead, consumption is merely a deduction-disallowance principle, and an insufficient (or incomplete) one at that. Part II discusses normative criteria underlying an income tax that point towards an objective ability-to-pay realization personal income tax. The notion of objective ability to pay is an internal-to-tax tax fairness norm that is constructed from the ground up by considering the role of taxation (in a liberal society) to raise cash revenue in an annual budget cycle. It also happens that an ability-to-pay personal income tax can, itself perform a mildly redistributive function. (Incidentally, it is argued in this part that indexing of basis is improper from a tax fairness perspective.) Part III follows with an outline of basic features of such a tax. Some controversial points raised in Part III include abolition of the accrual method of tax accounting, disallowing depreciation deductions, and a thorough revamping of the tax treatment of borrowing.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2053275,Deconstructing Haig-Simons Income and Reconstructing It as Objective Ability-to-Pay Income

The near collapse of economies with the attendant job losses has brought forth the need for effective social policies, particularly in developing countries, that can serve citizens in dire need. Consequently, many of these countries have had to craft emergency social policies to help their citizens. Ghana is no exception. While measures to control the spread of the pandemic, such as lockdowns and restrictions on movement and gathering, were timely, they negatively impacted the poor, most of whom work in the informal sector and depend on daily survival activities such as buying and selling basic goods. As a result, some of the measures were ignored as people feared they would die from hunger rather than from the pandemic. Thus, governmental response to the pandemic was highlighted by policy layering and exposed the fragile social support systems in existence. The challenges of responding adequately to the pandemic underscore the importance of a transformative social welfare regime in ensuring the protection of citizens. This paper, based on desk research, explores the limitations of the existing social policy framework, which became manifest during the implementation of Ghana’s pandemic policies. Policy layering by government continues to weaken Ghana’s social welfare system, and this affected the official response with respect to the social issues that have emerged due to the pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.1093/polsoc/puac008,"“Provide our basic needs or we go out”: the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, inequality, and social policy in Ghana"

As a result, many high-income countries (HICs) instituted complete travel bans on persons leaving South Africa and other neighbouring countries. These bans were unnecessary from a scientific standpoint, and they ran counter to the International Health Regulations. In short, South Africa was penalized for sharing data. Data sharing during pandemics is commonly justified by appeals to solidarity. In this paper, we argue that solidarity is, at best, an aspirational ideal to work toward but that it cannot ground an obligation to share data. Instead, low-and-middle income countries (LIMCs) should be guided by the principle of reciprocity, which states that we ought to return good for good received. Reciprocity is necessarily a conditional principle.

The current article contributes to existing knowledge by studying public support for basic income from a multidimensional perspective, using a vignette experiment that charts popular support for a broad range of differently designed types of basic income. The results demonstrate that support for basic income is indeed inherently multidimensional, for three main reasons. First, some types of basic income are more popular than others, especially those that are conditional and equity-based. Second, people make significant trade-offs between various policy design dimensions and the deservingness criteria associated with them. Third, there are important differences in the types of basic income preferred by specific ideological groups: while left-wing people differentiate little between various proposals, their right-wing counterparts clearly prefer more-restrictive proposals. By situating these findings in a comparative perspective, the article proposes a novel conceptual framework, which postulates that the multidimensionality of support for basic income is context dependent. From a policy point-of-view, this is relevant in light of the crucial role played by public opinion in determining the political feasibility of implementing some form of basic income in a real-world setting.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2055112,The multidimensionality of public support for basic income: a vignette experiment in Belgium

In a broad sense, epistemic equality describes the idea that every individual has an equal right to speak up and to be heard if she has relevant information or knowledge to share, questions to ask, or complaints to bring forward. Epistemic equality has moral, instrumental, and instrumentally moral value in organizations. Drawing on Miranda Fricker’s work on epistemic injustice (2009), I argue that we have good reasons to postulate epistemic equality as a normative ideal for organizations, even if – and precisely because – they are otherwise hierarchically structured. The hypothesis I then proceed to explore is that an unconditional basic income, by providing better opportunities for “exit”, might be a step that would strengthen epistemic equality in organizations.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0009,Basic Income and the Ideal of Epistemic Equality

Research in labor economics has rarely turned to long-run aims; and, while this was to be expected in a day in which their attainment was precluded by the inability of weak unions to win even their immediate goals, it is perhaps time to make the question an object of serious study.

Progress was anyway limited in bringing down the numbers on incapacity benefits, and in older industrial Britain in particular, where so many of these claimants are concentrated, there is a pressing need to rethink welfare reform. Since 1997 the assumption underpinning just about all Labour's welfare reforms has been that if claimants look for work, and equip themselves for work, they should be able to find work. This assumption was always rather questionable in some parts of the country, and in the wake of recession now looks distinctly outmoded. The time has arrived for a rethink. During the long economic boom in the decade and a half up to 2008, Labour's approach to bringing down benefit numbers was not without merit. The growing economy was generating more jobs - more than two million of them - so there was a clear need to make sure that benefit claimants had the skills and motivation to fill emerging vacancies. There was also a need to ensure that moving into work was financially worthwhile, which is where tax credits (and to some extent the minimum wage) fitted into the jigsaw.",,Welfare to work: time for a rethink Welfare to work: time for a rethink Welfare to work: time for a rethink Welfare to work: time for a rethink

One reason for the political opposition was the widespread fear that a guaranteed income would reduce the work effort of poor breadwinners and, as a result, cost taxpayers a great deal of money. In an effort to gain some knowledge about the potential impact of a guaranteed income on labor force activity, the federal government in the late 1960s and 1970s sponsored four large-scale social experiments to measure individuals’ responses to different levels of benefits and tax rates. Although the negative income tax itself has fallen from favor, the labor supply question and the other basic issues studied in these experiments are still relevant to the current social welfare debates. Architects of new programs need to know the effects of particular reforms on work effort, family stability, housing, food consumption and the well-being of dependent children. The negative income tax was tested in four separate experiments. The first experiment, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, lasted from 1968",,Lessons from the income maintenance experiments: an overview

0.9818803,44.368725,4,"The argument presented in this article is that although work is one path toward improved well-being for poor families, a successful and humane social welfare policy must recognize and respond to its limitations. The prowork rhetoric surrounding current efforts to move women from welfare to work rests on at least three propositions: Work is the norm, work is good for families, and work leads to self-sufficiency. The article reviews empirical evidence on each of these propositions and concludes that many former welfare participants will earn low wages in unstable employment and will require a broad range of supports to move from welfare to self-sufficiency and improved family well-being. Key words: employment; policy; single mothers; TANF; welfare reform The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) eliminated the long-standing entitlement to cash assistance for poor mothers and their children. In its place, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides states with funding for time-limited, work-based welfare programs. TANF required that by 2000 single mothers with school-age children receiving benefits work at least 30 hours per week. By imposing lifetime limits of no more than 60 months of benefits, although states may impose shorter time limits, and many have done so (Gallagher, Gallagher, Perese, Schreier, & Watson, 1998), the new legislation further manifests the expectation that families will make the transition to self-support. The argument here is that although work is an important path toward improved well-being for poor families, a successful and humane social welfare policy must recognize and respond to its limitations. Contemporary society appears to view employment as the avenue to women's economic security, at least for poor women. Earlier generations regarded marriage and the male breadwinner as the key. Marriage was and continues to be a strong link to economic well-being for women with children. Unmarried women with children are about five times more likely to be poor than their married counterparts. In 1995, 42 percent of single-mother families with children were poor, compared with fewer than 8 percent of married couple families with children (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). Marriage is, however, only a partial solution. Even a generation ago, not every woman married, not all marriages lasted, and not all husbands were able and willing to support a family. Declines in marriage, high divorce rates, and stagnating male earnings (especially among low-skilled men) mean that marriage is an increasingly incomplete path to economic well-being (Acs & Danziger, 1993; Spain & Bianchi, 1996). Yet, just as marriage was never a guaranteed path to economic security, work is a limited alternative. Just as not all women marry, not every woman has employment opportunities or the skills necessary to take advantage of such opportunities (Holzer, 1996; Spalter-Roth, Burr, Hartmann, & Shaw, 1995). Employment, even more than marriage, can be a temporary state (Cancian & Meyer, 2000; Pavetti & Acs, 1996). Moreover, women with low levels of education and other employment skills are particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations and are likely to be employed in occupations that fail to offer stable employment (Pavetti & Acs; Spalter-Roth et al., 1995). Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (P.L. 87-543) and its precursors were designed in large part to offset the loss of economic support associated with the absence of a husband and father. If we are to rely on a work-based approach to economic support, current policies must accommodate the irregular and insufficient earnings that can be expected for many single mothers. Many women who move from welfare to work will find themselves in low-paying jobs with limited prospects for advancement. Women of color face particular challenges in moving from welfare to work; they are likely to face discriminatory attitudes of employers and fellow employees (Henly, 2000; Holzer, 1999; Kirschenman & Neckerman, 1991), to live in areas with high unemployment, and to have lower levels of formal education (Holzer & Danziger, 1998). …",https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/46.4.309,Rhetoric and Reality of Work-Based Welfare Reform

Some UBI proposals have the potential to advance equity and social justice, while others may result in a net welfare loss. The ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation (No. 202) includes a number of principles which are highly relevant to guide the debate on UBI, namely: (i) adequacy and predictability of UBI benefits to ensure income security, set at least at the national poverty line; (ii) social inclusion, including of persons in the informal economy; (iii) social dialogue and consultation with stakeholders; (iv) enactment of national laws regulating UBI entitlements, including indexation of benefits; (v) coherence with other social, economic and employment policies, and (vi) sustainable and equitable financing.

This represents 44 per cent of all federal outlays, compared to 19 per cent in fiscal year 1956. These benefit payments are for social security, federal employee benefits, veterans benefits, public assistance, unemployment insurance, railroad retirement, food and nutrition, health care, and housing programs. If these programs are evaluated on the basis of their efficiency, the conclusion is that they are not carried out at minimal cost. Many in fact are clearly uncontrollable. If these programs are evaluated on the basis of their effectiveness, the conclusion is that they are not achieving their objectives. Many in fact do not have clearly defined goals. In 1953 when HEW was founded, its spending amounted to less than 34 for every $1 of federal outlays. The HEW empire now accounts for more than one-third of the total U. S. budget. At the past decade's rate of increase, the Department will be paying out more than $500 billion a year by the year 1985. Every seventh person in the United States receives a monthly check directly from some HEW agency. It dispenses funds through 300 major programs and thousands of smaller ones.

Using longitudinal administrative data and discrete time linear probability models, we follow all social assistance recipients in the Netherlands from 2010 to 2015, and analyse whether, and for whom, low income work functions as a stepping stone towards sustainable self-sufficiency. We find that social assistance recipients are more likely to become self-sufficient when they are active in low income work. This stepping stone effect applies in particular to benefit recipients with limited work experience, a higher educational level, a shorter duration of welfare receipt and to those who belong to the native Dutch majority. The type of employment also matters: low income work through temporary employment agencies is found to be the most effective stepping stone towards self-sufficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcab003,From Social Assistance to Self-Sufficiency: Low Income Work as a Stepping Stone

The speed and severity of the viral contagion has rendered devastatingly, undeniably visible the vast, racial gap between those with reliable health care, child care, housing, nutrition, household wealth, and income and those without, but that gap was already widening well before the pandemic amid accelerating economic inequality, racial disparity, and precarity for those fortunate enough to find paid work.

With physical health and safety linked inextricably to material deprivation came heightened public demands for racial, social, and economic justice to help marginalized communities not just survive in times of crisis, but thrive every day. 

This Article examines reinvigorated proposals for universal basic income (UBI) and a federal job guarantee (JG) to reduce poverty, income inequality, and the widening racial wealth gap. It examines the potential of such reforms to put more money into the hands of those most likely to use it while ending involuntary unemployment and boosting labor conditions for all, but especially Blacks and people of color with less access to generational wealth, higher education, and protection against employment discrimination.

We examine the failure of the 1960s “War on Poverty”, the strategy adopted by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to deal with poverty, in large part because it did not provide decent jobs to the poor. As a result, the link between joblessness and poverty remains strong. We compare and contrast two rival approaches to dealing with poverty: the Basic Income Guarantee that would provide income to all, and the Job Guarantee that would provide a job to anyone willing to work. This is particularly important in the context of concerns that increasing “robotization” of the economy is destroying jobs.

41.663044,-32.37233,4,"The government of Finland has the ambition of making Finland the first fossil-free welfare state in the world and reaching carbon neutrality in 2035. Simultaneously, worktime reduction and basic income have been matters of vivid political debate. Both worktime reduction and basic income are go-to solutions for post-growth scholars as ways to arrange welfare in a non-growing economy. These initiatives could thereby support the climate goals of the government– but are concerns with limits to growth distinguishable in the debates? In this thesis, I have mapped out the political debate in Finland surrounding the welfare reforms of worktime reduction and basic income to explore how growth-sustainability tensions are addressed and if welfare alternatives are limited due to the growth paradigm.

To see whether post-growth ideas are present in Finnish party politics, I interviewed eleven candidates from seven parties in the Finnish parliament to see on which grounds these initiatives are proposed and opposed. I found that the main driver of the debate is the transformation of work in the 21st Century, rather than the ecological crises we are facing. Most interviewees did not link Finland’s environmental goals to the two welfare initiatives discussed. Nevertheless, a minority considered basic income and worktime reduction to be sustainability strategies. There is recognition of limits to growth among politicians, and possibly more broadly in the parties they stood election for.

It appears that the growth paradigm is being politically contested. Although most respondents considered economic growth as a solution to social and ecological problems, growth was given instrumental value rather than being blindly pursued. The welfare state of Finland is embedded in a system depending on growth, whereby there is concern that current levels of welfare cannot be realised in a non-growing economy. Thereby the barriers to transition are more structural than narrative, although the latter was also distinguishable in the data.

I conclude that concerns with limits to growth are present in Finnish party politics. The political discussions on worktime reduction and basic income would benefit from including the potential co-benefits between social and environmental sustainability that post-growth scholars argue these initiatives have. This connection is however not without tension. As alternative methods of financing the welfare state have not been convincingly mapped out, reliance on growth to solve ecological and social problems is likely to continue.",,Is the time for leisure now? : The growth paradigm in the Finnish welfare debate

Who would argue with that? Taking a closer look, however, there is much uncertainty as to what exactly is meant and how a UBI should work and be financed. This was also evident during the Covid 19 pandemic, when proposals were made to use a temporary basic income to cushion the economic consequences for the population and especially its particularly vulnerable sections. For example a study for the United Nations Development Programme proposed this for the world’s three billion poorest people. But this would be neither universal nor sufficient – in average US$ 2.50 per person per day. In the paper there is also a positive reference to Spain, where a ‘basic income’ was introduced. There it concerns however an even worse Spanish variant of the German model of basic security for needy unemployed (‘Hartz IV’), which is criticised by the trade unions as too low and too repressive. UBI as a rescue against the crisis? For Germany this discussion makes little sense. This is a country with a highly developed social welfare system, which showed its performance in the ongoing crisis – despite of all problems and legitimate criticisms. This system is characterised by social insurance schemes, which involve the vast majority of the population – in particular, dependent employees and their families – which provide benefits on the basis of contributions paid. Especially, the short-time work allowance saved millions from falling into unemployment. But nevertheless many mini-jobbers, self-employed and small entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit. They often have low incomes anyway and need every euro, but do not receive short-time work benefits or unemployment benefits because they are not covered by unemployment insurance. If they are needy, they can apply for basic security, but this is below the German poverty line. For the German UBI community this is rather a deterrent example, they see a ‘real UBI’ as the fundamental alternative to this means-tested basic provision. A UBI as they mean it is intended to be an income that the government pays unconditionally to each person, regardless of what income that person receives or what assets they possess. There is no means testing and each person receives the same amount (only children less). The UBI should be high enough to cover basic needs and guarantee social participation. The search for gainful employment would not be required. As a response to the Covid 19 crisis more than 400,000 people supported a petition that demands the introduction of an unconditional basic income of 800-1200 euro per person and month in Germany for 6 months. This would cost about 500 billion euro, which would be 3 or 4 times the complete public expenditure on education. But why should everyone receive such an unconditional basic income (BGE) as a measure against the crisis, although for many, fortunately the majority of employees, the income is not at all lost, but continues as before? For the majority of the employees hit by the crisis the short-time work allowance or even the unemployment benefit is better than such a UBI would be. On the other hand, such an UBI would not be a rescue for the many self-employed and small businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy because their income is lost but they still have to pay various running costs, rents, etc. Targeted aid for those who need it would also make more economic sense so that they can get started again after the crisis. And this would be far less expensive because far fewer people than the entire population would receive it. Arguments against demands for a UBI In principle, the various arguments that speak against a UBI also apply to a corona crisis UBI. Why should the vast majority of the population receive this money, although they do not need it at all?

Without taking issue with the revision itself, I point out that Howard, like many others, fails to defend UBI as non-exploitative. All his arguments fail to establish that the so-called ‘Surfer off Malibu’, a figure who is full-time dedicated to leisure, is not an exploiter in receiving UBI.

Unsystematic institution of property rights is also decreasing farmers anticipated income. An abnormal pattern of national income has deprived the farmers from their interests obtained. Low degree of organized productivity is speeding the loss of interests for these farmers. Lack of institution of social security in many rural areas and the exclusive status for farmers have changed into a heavy burden over farmers shoulders.

-23.93614,21.606531,2,"Proponents and opponents of a universal basic income all acknowledge that the most significant political challenge to its adoption in the United States is that a universal basic income would not have a work requirement attached. Often, this is characterized as a problem involving incentives—the availability of a universal basic income would cause many people to stop working (or significantly curtail the number of hours that they work) and simply live off the universal basic income. This Article makes three contributions to the literature related to a universal basic income: First, it provides a typology for understanding the many reasons for valuing work; second, it argues that the United States is unlikely to implement a universal basic income because a universal basic income does not account for several aspects of the value of work; and, third, it argues that advocates of a universal basic income should instead focus on the more modest goal of redefining the activities that constitute work and broadening the social safety net by expanding existing policies through the use of a broader definition of work. This Article proposes that the value of work in American political culture has four primary dimensions: 1) reciprocity, that one receives rewards for one’s labor, that one gets what one gives and that no one should be a free rider, one who gets but does not give; 2) calling or vocation, that work is a calling or vocation that one should have or pursue, and that only those that have or pursue such a calling or vocation have moral standing; 3) self sufficiency, that work promotes self sufficiency, which is a necessary component of liberty and which is necessary to avoid dependency; and 4) incentives, of an economic kind, that society should encourage work because it increases the size of the economic pie. These categories provide a new framework for thinking about the value of work and for evaluating policies that relate to the working lives of Americans. As an alternative to the adoption of a universal basic income, this Article proposes that proponents of a universal basic income should focus on expanding and redefining current policies, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit so that they more closely resemble a participation income. In fact, a broader definition of work has even been used in recent conservative policy ideas, such as the Medicaid work requirements that some states have introduced, which include within their definition of work the activities of education, job training, and community service. This Article closes with an outline of a proposal to adopt an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit that resembles a participation income and addresses each of the dimensions of the value of work.",,Something for Nothing: Universal Basic Income and the Value of Work Beyond Incentives

-19.740993,39.2952,3,"Universal Basic Income (UBI) is   concept that has recently begun to enter the popular political consciousness in the United States. It is defined as a regular cash income paid to all, on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It is invoked for   wide variety of political and social purposes, but is almost always presented as radically different from existing governmental welfare and transfer systems. Once   UBI is disaggregated into discrete policy components, it is possible to imagine to what degree existing programs share the benefits (and detriments) of   UBI to   greater or lesser degree, and reforms could be made to make existing programs more UBI-like, if that would be beneficial. 

This Article re-envisions   UBI as   series of reforms to one of the largest existing governmental transfer program in the US: the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is   work-conditional transfer program, and so any UBI-like reforms to the EITC will lack the defining characteristic of   UBI - that is it not work conditional. On the other hand,   number of reforms to the EITC would make the program more UBI-like. These include: (i) that the EITC phaseout be removed so the program is no longer means-tested (no means testing); (ii) that the program benefit be applied on an individual basis, decreasing the importance of support of custodial children (individuality); (iii) that the administration of the program be reformed so workers can receive payments throughout the year (regularity). By starting with the EITC and proposing   series of reforms to make it more UBI-like, one is able to accurately assess the differences between   UBI and at least one large governmental transfer program, diminishing the impression that   UBI is too utopian to actually become reality. One is further able to build on decades of tax policy research about the successes and failings of the EITC.

Of particular importance to both supporters and critics of the UBI is its lack of work requirement, and that is often its most philosophically controversial element. By exploring UBI-like reforms to the EITC (which is work conditional), this paper relaxes   defining aspect of the UBI - that it be free from work requirements. For some supporters, this makes any comparison between the program proposed and   UBI nonsensical. But the EITC is already more like   UBI than many work-conditional transfer programs, and reforms could make its work-conditionality even less problematic. Still, maintaining the EITC's structure as   work-conditional transfer program distinguishes it dramatically from   true UBI, and loses   number of the central benefits of   UBI. It is the premise of this paper that an exploration of   partial UBI of this nature -   compromise - is useful for future discussion of the issue, even if the proposed program is   distinct second best. It is not   coincidence that Senator Kamala Harris,   contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has proposed   UBI-like program, the LIFT the Middle Class Act, which shares many of the features of the reforms proposed in this Article.",,EITC for All: A Universal Basic Income Compromise Proposal

A universal no questions asked public transfer would be simple and have the advantage that no-one would be left without support. But an unconditional payment to everyone at meaningful but fiscally realistic levels would likely require tax rises as well as reductions in existing benefits. We develop a comprehensive BI scenario that facilitates an assessment of the resulting fiscal and distributional effects in a comparative context, undertake a microsimulation study to quantify them, and propose a simple decomposition to identify the mechanisms that drive effects in different country contexts. Results illustrate the challenges, but also the strengths, of existing social protection systems. A BI would fix benefit coverage gaps that exist in many countries, but would require very substantial tax rises if it were to be set at a meaningful level. As support would not be targeted on those most in need, it would not be a cost-effective way of directly reducing income poverty.",,Mechanics of Replacing Benefit Systems with a Basic Income: Comparative Results from a Microsimulation Approach
10.635518,21.359558,2,"Public performances carried out in support of the movement for a universal basic income—such as a massive ‘currency-dump’ of Swiss francs in a public square by a group of Swiss artists and activists, a series of ‘speculative advertisements’ by US artist Josh Kline, and a ‘robot march’ through the streets of Zurich—have tended to establish spectacular equivalencies between bodies and units of currency, and between bodies and machines, to demonstrate that the future of labour is marked by both economic abundance and unprecedented labor-substitutability. Historically, the concept has emerged from points across a wide political spectrum and the movement holds together a set of divergent political ideologies, which share the belief that the future might be simplified and secured by an economic floor. The universal basic income idea is, overall, profoundly performative, in that it attempts to model the ultimate pragmatism of wider social nets of generosity, and does so by representing the embodied conditions that might be brought into being by such generosity. In this way, the utopian heuristic of an unconditional, guaranteed income is said to be, in the words of Belgian political ethicist Philippe Van Parijs, an ‘instrument of freedom’ and a ‘device for economic sanity’. The question is though, as is often the case: freedom and sanity for whom? The movement, in reality, often falls short of its ‘universal’ aim.

The legislator and the judge, however, are enjoined from taking such an indefinite position. Debatable though the exact nature and best definition of income may be, definite decisions must be made if an income tax law is to be formulated and interpreted. Every question arising as to the advisability of including or excluding specific items as income must be given an answer with but little opportunity for hedging. Ever since the first direct income tax was levied by the federal government in i86i, the definition of income as a legal concept has been undergoing an evolution at the hands of Congress and the courts, primarily the Supreme Court of the United States. The ascertaining of this legal definition of income as it stands today, and the developments leading up to it, constitute the aims of this study. The first problem will be to trace the definition of income from law to law, starting with the i86i enactment and coming down to the present.

Considerable attention paid to the prospects for the introduction of unconditional basic income and the implementation of its basic principles into Ukrainian legislation. Various approaches of legal regulations and etymology of social policy in the context of the state security system are considered. Significant emphasis placed on the study of the theoretical challenge of unconditional basic income, namely the study of the functioning of such a mechanism in modern communicative realities. This research is a product of analytics and was created without taking into account the author’s political ideas. Given the recommended amount of research, the issues of unconditional basic income was considered not to be completed. Purpose. One of the main tasks of the article is to study the mechanism of functioning of unconditional basic income and the possibility of its application in practice. It is also worth giving your own view of the social policy problems. The tasks of the article are to analyze the modern social security system and to suggest options for its improvement. Results. The theory of unconditional basic income currently has no practical application. Despite a significant number of theoretical experiments, no country in the world uses the instrument of unconditional basic income at the legislative level. Therefore, it is too early to talk about the implementation of this theory of social policy in practice in Ukraine. Conclusions. Theory of unconditional basic income has a strong intellectual tradition, but the practical application of this instrument of social policy not implemented. Our studies show that such a system promotes the development of human capital and increases the geographical mobility of people. Unconditional basic income creates material support that promotes human development in other spheres of life.

This creates material barriers for some countries to use unconditional basic income as a tool of social policy.

Using India as an illustration, the paper discusses the trade-offs that need to be recognized in adopting a UBI in these contexts. It shows that replacing the 2011 Public Distribution System (PDS) with a UBI results in losses for many low-income households, although much of this can be reduced by recycling the 'out-of-system' PDS losses and the fiscal savings from excluding the highest-income groups as higher UBI transfers. In contrast, replacing inefficient energy subsidies-raising energy prices to efficient levels to internalize the negative environmental externalities of energy consumption-could simultaneously deliver unambiguous distributional gains, help address fiscal pressures, and improve energy efficiency with associated environmental and health gains.

Compared to those who have full-time and permanent contracts, fixed-term full- and part-timers (rather than part-timers with permanent jobs) are the most prone to support basic income. Personal experiences of insecurity in the labour market are likely to affect how people view the desirability of basic income. According to the results, inadequate income increases the probability of supporting basic income. Opinions are also based on the two views of deservingness: individual blame (social problems are a result of individuals’ actions) or social blame (individual problems have social roots). Those who emphasise individual blame are sceptical about unconditional transfers, whereas the opposite is true with regard to social blame that is positively linked to the support for basic income. The two dimensions of deservingness are also strongly linked to individual political affiliation.

One problem with a stable basic income across life is that it seems unfair to shorter-lived persons, who are worst-off due to premature death and receive less over their whole lives. Basic capital solves this problem by providing a one-off grant to the young, but I argue that it mistreats long-lived persons, as it does not guarantee their real freedom across life. There is a dilemma between these proposals regarding their respective unfairness to the short- and long-lived. The solution I propose is a net basic income of decreasing magnitude until a specific age, after which the income is constant. This solution is compatible with constant income benefits across life, and it offers a fair answer to the problem of unequal longevity, a widely neglected but essential challenge in debates about basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0007,Basic Income and Unequal Longevity

30.74837,-12.45817,4,"This paper is focused on a specific reform strategy - the Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI).It addresses an age-old issue of social welfare programming in a market
economy. How do we maintain an incentive to work yet provide a safety net for those shaken loose by large-scale yet seemingly continuous change? Why participate in a losing cause if the consequences of not participating are not all that bad materially? The problem is particularly acute when the financial rewards of work and the type of work available both continue to deteriorate for a very broad class of people, as is happening in Canada. Even worse, how does one prevent the development of a welfare culture that is tolerated, if not totally accepted, to the point that it becomes immune to moral suasion from the broader community?

The Guaranteed Annual Income concept has been debated for some time in academic circles and widely discussed in a larger public policy circle. This paper briefly documents the various public reviews of the concept in Canada over the past 25 years.   It details the major benefit of a GAI, principally in terms of reducing the disincentive to work in the current program.   It also outlines the downside of a potentially much more expensive program as benefits are spread across a larger population of working poor.

The paper demonstrates that a modest federal GAl is financially viable even in the current context of fiscal restraint. Ample monies could be found from a reform of the Unemployment Insurance program by reducing eligibility, reducing benefits, and moving to experience-rated premiums for employers. These reforms would reduce the program's considerable income redistribution between regions, individuals, families, and employers. The result would be a program that is more clearly an insurance program against the adverse consequences of short-term unemployment. The paper’s estimates of savings and costs are slightly dated now because of government changes since the paper was written, but the general point remains intact.

As noted, even in administrative terms, the federal government has already gone a substantial way in its tax structure toward being able to implement a GAl. Moreover, under such a program the federal government would work directly with low-income people.   In the most cost-effective manner, that is, by sending money. In doing so, it would also have the opportunity to maintain its profile in the broader community. This would leave the provinces, and through them the municipalities and other agencies, free to deal more closely with those needing other forms of assistance. Inevitably these will be more selective, and therefore more information intensive and probably more labour intensive. That is as it should be if these governments are to pursue their respective competitive advantages.",,Income Security Reform and the Concept of a Guaranteed Annual Income

The chapter presents a concrete proposal that takes seriously the problem of policy design. The proposed Benefit Transfer Programme (BTP) is voluntary and relatively simple. The programme aims to reduce long-duration unemployment by allowing individuals who have been unemployed for a minimum period of time to convert their unemployment insurance benefits into either recruitment or training vouchers. In this way, it would remove disincentives to job search in unemployment insurance schemes and replace them with incentives for hiring and training. Moreover, the programme is designed to be neutral with respect to government expenditures; and to the extent that the programme reduces unemployment and thereby enlarges the tax base, it will increase government revenues.

That so many men-that, indeed, the average man-should unhesitatingly subscribe to that assertion or generalization is indisputably a significant fact, one that attests the ingrained belief in the idea of progress. Taking a concrete case, if we should say that the interest question will never be settled until it is settled right, would any thoughtful man venture to challenge the affirmation?

In recognition of this problem and the complexity of issues that contribute to the gender and race of poverty and the urgent need for innovative solutions to ending poverty among women, the American Association of Law Schools Sections on Clinical Education and Poverty Law sponsored a joint session at the 2012 Annual Meeting: Theory and Praxis in Reducing Women's Poverty. During that session, presenters and participants assessed the barriers poverty creates for poor women and their families, proposed explanations for women's poverty and explored remedies to help ameliorate, or at least mediate, women's low socioeconomic status. The session served as a foundation for further thoughtful and penetrating discourse on the intersection of poverty and gender, as well as the role of lawyers and law schools in developing insights and methods regarding law reform and advocacy for impoverished communities. Women, and the families and communities to which they are connected, interact with legal systems on a daily basis, often to their own detriment. As this symposium demonstrates, women's poverty intersects with multiple diverse areas of law, including employment, immigration, criminal, government benefits, family, education, and judicial systems. The focus on reducing women's poverty allows for a dissection and examination of these systems and the conditions that perpetuate the low socioeconomic status of women, particularly minority women.This symposium confronts the role of the family, the community, and the nation from domestic and international perspectives.",,Foreward Symposium: Theory and Praxis in Reducing Women's Poverty

This achievement shows the potential to move existing homes toward the Zero Energy ideal in a cost effective manner without the need to start new programs. Wisconsin’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) is continually searching for simple, robust standards to define appropriate energy conservation measures. The federal Energy Star ® program has proven to be an effective tool for this purpose. Wisconsin’s program has established a requirement for Energy Star ® for many equipment types, including furnaces, refrigerators, freezers, compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), air conditioners, and ventilation fans. The program also requires Energy Star ® for equipment installed primarily for health and safety reasons rather than energy savings, such as dehumidifiers, and windows. Weatherization agencies use formal competitive bidding to drive down costs of this equipment. Discussion will cover experiences with procurement and other issues with obtaining Energy Star ® products. This paper will present data from Wisconsin’s weatherization program, illustrating how the program achieved cost-effective energy savings even while specifying premium efficiency products.

The chapter elaborates the fairness argument for conditionality that focuses on the principle of reciprocity: that those who choose to share in the benefits created by others' productive efforts should make a reciprocal effort in return. It indicates how this principle, far from being a 'neo-liberal' idea, is deeply rooted in egalitarian traditions of political thought and how making a minimum income conditional on work is also a common-place within this tradition.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the need for protection (microtakaful) among low income and the poor respondents and finally to develop a suitable microtakaful model based on the findings of the survey, theories and literature reviews. Firstly, need for protection was examined by investigating respondents' demographic profile, their exposure to risks, vulnerability (coping strategies), their financial literacy (ability to save and indebtedness), the awareness level, their capacity to contribute, attitude and trust towards takaful or insurance. Secondly, a new variable namely capacity to contribute was established to investigate the statistical relationship with the need for protection. Thirdly, this study employed income and education level as moderators to moderate vulnerabilities and need for protection. The objective is to find the moderation effect of income and education level on vulnerabilities and need for protection. Another new moderator namely government role is employed to test the relationship between capacity to contribute and need for protection. Fourth, this study also investigates respondents' protection and contribution method preferences, mode of contribution and finally an affordable amount that they are willing to part with on a monthly basis. Need for protection would reflect the potential demand for these population; low income and poor. A face-to-face survey via 760 questionnaires from low income and poor group with household monthly income ofRM2,000 and below has been conducted in Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu. Data was collected and subsequently analyzed to gauge on how microtakaful will be able to assist them in uplifting their economic status. A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique by using AMOS 20.0 software is applied to this research. Six hypotheses namely risks exposure (HI), vulnerability (H₂) , awareness level (H₃) , attitude and trust (H₄) , ability to save (H₅) and capacity to contribute (H₆) on the relationship with need for protection were examined. Another three hypotheses namely income level (H₇) , educational level (H₈) and government role (H₉) were examined under moderation effect. Results indicated that five hypotheses (H₁, H₂, H₃, H₅, and H₆) out of six hypotheses are statistically significant. However, hypothesis H4 (attitude and trust) was rejected because it was not found to be significant in the hypothesized direction. Hypotheses of income level (H₇), education level (H₈) and government role (H₉) found to be statistically significant and have moderating effects.

Previous researches provided findings that the evaluation of income inequality is different within social groups. Thus, the sample of informants was based on these findings and defined by education, gender, residential place and age.

The findings of the research revealed that subjective meanings and experiences of income inequality in everyday life include the labour market, the capacities to consume, the ignorance of income inequality and its evaluation in relation with corruption. The experiences and meanings of income inequality are mainly related with the feeling of injustice in the labour market. The injustice in the labour market is related with the inequality of high wages among managers and subordinates, among private and public sector, among foreign and national capital enterprises employees, and etc. The injustice in the consumption field as a consequence of income inequality is perceived among families with children or retirees, who try to balance their expenses and income every day.

Surveys are being conducted around the world on the need to introduce basic income. Dynamics of economic processes and social sentiment in individual countries require generalisation of modern factors influencing the possibility of practical implementation of the concept of basic income. This paper studies the economic and psychological factors for supporting the idea of basic income in terms of its practical implementation, analyses the interpretation of the UBI idea by various researchers and provides a characteristic of the modern vision of basic income. The arguments for and against the practical implementation of this idea with their structuring in the following directions are formed and considered: influence on the economy, change of social relations and possibility of practical realisation.

On the household level, we find substantial and rather persistent losses in per capita labour income.

Arguments are presented in favor of the fact that distribution in proportion to needs is not a specifically communist principle and is realized in the system of a modern market economy, primarily through the free provision of educational and medical services and the payment of social transfers. The authors reveal the characteristic of modern society contradiction between the tendency towards the prevalence of the principle of distribution in proportion to the needs in the areas that directly ensure human development and the linkage of material well-being to factor income. It is noted that the resolution of this contradiction requires the introduction of a universal transfer in order to ensure the primary conditions of human development. The identity of such a transfer and UBI is shown. The historically transitory nature of the UBI concept formation in isolation from the idea of distribution by the needs is revealed. It is substantiated that UBI, as the initial form of the universal implementation of the principle of distribution in proportion to needs, complements factor income generation and is not the primary source of welfare for each member of society.

Income is the basis for assigning tax burdens, for distributing transfers, and for broader normative issues of inequality and justice. Yet we lack a single shared conception of income, and a pure, rigorous definition of income is impossible. In this Article I review the intellectual history of the income concept among tax and fiscal theorists to show the difficulty of the problem, and also to show that some important debates about what’s proper under an income tax can be explained instead as arguments over competing income definitions that necessarily incorporate policy choices. These insights are applied to more modern questions, like the role
of tax expenditure analysis and optimal income tax theory. I also perform—for the first time in the literature—a close examination and comparison of 12 different income definitions used by the federal government for different purposes. This examination illustrates that there is wide range of income concepts actively in use, but that the measure of income for tax purposes has a prominent and growing role.
This Article concludes that income is not a pure, external concept, but actually a constructed concept that necessarily embodies policy, and therefore political, goals. The differences between the income concepts and definitions examined here result directly from the
policy goals of the various agencies, analysts, and scholars using those concepts. Therefore, the increasing reliance on the measure of income for tax purposes risks erroneously exporting what are essentially tax policy decisions into non-tax areas, such as transfer policy, health care subsidization, higher education grants and loans, and broader discussions on income inequality and economic justice.",,The definition of income

Some distributions qualify for a variety of special federal income tax treatments while others are taxed as ordinary income.In 1974, Congress proposed to equalize the total tax of taxpayers who receive distributions from retirement plans regardless of whether the distributions are received in a lump sum or as an annuity. The legislation provided a ten-year forward averaging rule for determining the tax to taxpayers receiving a lump sum distribution from a qualified pension plan. This rule was subsequently modified to five-year forward averaging in 1986.Congress recently repealed the five-year averaging rule and enacted a simplified method for determining an annuity's return on investment. The justification for the new legislation was “simplicity” rather than the original purpose — to prevent the bunching of taxable income into a single year as results from a lump sum distribution.Although Congress set out to equalize the income tax across the two forms of distributions, after two decades of tinkering, the law penalizes taxpayers who elect to receive the deferred compensation in the form of a lump sum distribution and, thereby, encourages the withdrawal of retirement assets over the life of the retiree all in the name of simplification.

10.994887,30.909922,4,"Economists have had tremendous influence in designing antipoverty programs in both Great Britain and America over the last 200 years. However, today’s economic experts have lost some respect for the wisdom of non-experts, or ordinary people, that was held in high regard by their intellectual forerunners. This article argues that the antipoverty programs designed by experts would be improved by the incorporating the wisdom of ordinary people. 
Classical economists from Adam Smith (the founder of modern economics) to John Stuart Mill (“the most influential English language philosopher of the nineteenth century” according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) believed that experts should pay close attention to the wisdom of ordinary people that is captured in proverbs, or proverbial wisdom. 
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a proverb is a “short piece of advice” whereas wisdom is “knowledge or experience that develops within a society or period”. We can think of proverbial wisdom as advice that represents practical knowledge. In other words, proverbial wisdom is similar to aggregated anecdotal evidence that has been passed between people across time. 
The primary difference between economic experts today and non-experts is that experts see the world through formal models, whereas non-experts use the summation of experiences. A measure of these experiences (for instance, the experience of the median person or even the median voter) are transmittable through proverbial wisdom. The public policies of poor relief since the 1800s have been driven by debates over expert models and not debates between models and proverbial wisdom. Put another way, the rise in the expert has led to the fall of proverbial wisdom. 
Proverbs, as the reflection of human experience, could help to avoid injustice by guiding a system of heuristics to help with judging morality. For both Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, the “Golden Rule” which they attributed to Jesus Christ, was especially meaningful in this regard. However, reliance the proverbs without the application of reason was not only unwise, but equivalent to idolatry. 
This article covers the “rise of the welfare expert” and the development of antipoverty policy in both Great Britain and the United States since the 1500s. The article also covers the use of proverbs in classical economics. Finally, the article concludes by making recommendations on how antipoverty might be improved in the United States.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3194637,"Bringing Proverbs to Policy: Classical Economics, Proverbial Wisdom, and Applications for Welfare Policy"

In accordance with this conception, the origin of the discrimination suffered by persons with disabilities is mainly social because we have designed our society without universal access for everybody. There is a normality criterion, based on physical capabilities, intelligence, race and gender that excludes many people from that canon. The different contemporary liberal theories of justice have discussed disabilities thinking about how the State could compensate brute luck. In this context, does universal basic income play some role? Van Parijs in Real Freedom for All defends a unanimous criterion to compensate for brute luck. That compensation would be made before distributing an equal basic income among everybody. In this paper, UBI will be studied in the context of the debate about rights of persons with disabilities. Firstly, the argument given by Van Parijs will be discussed because the unanimous requirement does not fit with a social understanding of disabilities. Secondly, if we consider a right to UBI, it is necessary to study which role this right can play in the life of people with disabilities and if we can say that this right has a universal design.

However, although the principles of universality, progressivity, solidarity and financial sustainability govern the system, it is currently evident that only 25% of the population is covered. The system excludes people who contributed and did not manage to retire or those who did not contribute due to the reality of the Colombian and Latin American labor markets.

We study a simple economy, involving a benevolent policy-maker and a population of agents differing in terms of productivities, labor supply elasticities, and shifting costs. Paying special attention to the cost structure of income shifting, we highlight that when people who shift easily along the extensive margin are also more elastic in labor supply, giving them a lower tax rate is a good thing, and the government should not necessarily combat income shifting. This mechanism may be compared to third-degree price discrimination in industrial organization and works as a form of endogenous tagging.

8.648137,-21.148926,0,"It is a defining characteristic of the Welfare State that it recognizes a fundamental responsibility for ensuring all its residents a reasonable standard of living including a minimum level of disposable income. While existing welfare states rely on a range of indirect and conditional measures to help secure the economic well-being of the entire population, the institution of a generous and unconditional basic income can be seen as an alternative and, admittedly, very radical operationalization of this commitment. Although the idea of a basic income granted to all residents has for long been seriously debated among social philosophers and social policy analysts, it is often ignored or rejected as utopian if not entirely undesirable in practical political discourses. One argument frequently made against an unconditional basic income is that it would invariably fail to gain legitimacy in the general public. Most existing social security systems are designed to appeal to the self interest of ordinary taxpayers and to notions of reciprocity by linking benefits to prior contributions. They also typically contain features that are meant to discourage and stigmatize “undeserving” beneficiaries, and they maintain the right to withhold benefits from able bodied individuals of working age who openly refuse to take up paid work. The presumption is that these various strategies to condition the distribution of benefits are necessary to secure popular support for institutions that do, nevertheless, achieve a great deal in terms of poverty alleviation and economic redistribution. Clearly it must be conceded that the introduction of a generous and unconditional basic income will put a high demand on people’s willingness to share economic risks and resources with their fellow citizens - in short: on social solidarity. Although there are segments of the population who could be expected to support such a move out of pure self interest, this will hardly suffice in itself. Sustained support from a majority of the population must require a high degree of trust, identification and sympathy with fellow citizens and/or a strong commitment to egalitarian values that cannot be taken for granted. It is therefore – at least in our opinion – highly relevant to ask under what conditions, if any, one can expect there to be sufficient popular support for such a radical scheme in the electorates of contemporary nation states.",,The limits of social solidarity: Popular attitudes towards basic income in a Nordic welfare state

-0.6803422,36.9203,4,"In 2007 and 2008, experiments were carried out on Active Solidarity Income (RSA) in 34 French departements. Each of these departements defined one or more test zones or experimental zones, where the new benefits were implemented. In total, 51 test zones were chosen by the departements. So as to evaluate the effects of the RSA, we built and implemented a methodology enabling the definition of control zones in each experimenting departement. These control territories were selected in such a way as to provide the most satisfying counterfactual possible for the evaluation of the test zones, taking into account the inherent limits of local statistics on return to employment behaviour. The first step, for a given departement, was to establish a list of possible control zones whose socio-demographic characteristics were comparable to those of the test zone, notably as regards size (population, number of RMI, or Minimum Income Allowance, beneficiaries), the density of the population and the administrative situation (canton, CLI, UTAS, CAS, etc.). The second step was to classify all of these possible zones, from the closest to the test zones as regards the possibility to entry into a job for the RMI beneficiaries as estimated using the CNAF’s (National Family Allowance Fund) administrative data. To do this, every semester there is a reconstruction of the rate of entry into a job for the Minimum Income beneficiaries on the communal level from June 2002 to June 2007 whilst neutralising the effects of constituting the beneficiaries according to characteristics observable in the administrative files. In the third step, the control zones were proposed to the experimenting departements, which were then able to make counterproposals backed up with arguments in case of disagreement. In practice, the choice of this iterative procedure enabled a good compromise between the principle of national unity in the selection process of control zones and putting local informational systems and knowledge of the field to the best possible use.",,Defining Control Zones for Active Solidarity Income Experimentation
28.438828,-4.71868,4,"This thesis explores the implication of equality in debates about distributive justice. It is argued that equality articulates a particular mode of social relationship, namely that relationship which retains the equal moral worth of each member of a political community. One way to achieve this end is to arrange rules and procedure governing the distribution of goods and social relations in a way that ensures respect to each member of society. This particular mode of social relationship can be achieved without necessarily invoking strict equality in respect to the distribution of material goods. With respect to question of distributive justice, commitment to the ideal of social equality does not settle all distributive issues. Despite this, however, an appeal to social equality can help to clarify the tension between 'economic egalitarianism' and its critiques. An appeal to social equality demands the sufficiency approach to the distribution of material goods, and proposes unconditional basic income for all as a way to achieve it. This claim is supported by two additional arguments. First, complete achievement of equality of opportunity is undesirable because it undermines the 'legitimate differences' between persons. Second, it is argued that unconditional basic income for all provides citizens with a reasonable alternative to Rawls' 'fair division of responsibility'. This reasonable alternative, in turn, is necessary both to incur and to validate personal responsibility.",,The ideal of social equality: Critique of economic egalitarianism

These rules impute a return on equity, categorized as capital income, and tax the residual roughly at the rates levied on labor income. There are broadly two ways to calculate the capital income part. One is to impute a return on the acquisition price of shares (Sweden and Norway) and the second is to calculate a return on the net book assets of the firm (Finland). This paper addresses the economic effects of the net asset-based splitting method, which has not been studied thoroughly in earlier literature. Using a dynamic investment model, we show that at appropriately chosen parameter values the net assets-based split exhibits the key properties of the reportedly neutral ACE corporation tax.

A recent narrative, endorsed by prominent tech-billionaires, says we face mass unemployment, and we need a basic income. In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is an entirely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment, and it can be done again. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Taking lessons from history, it is clear that unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy.

At micro-level, the utility-maximization problems of asymmetric agents are formulated and solved for optimal labour supplies. New macro-level equilibrium solutions, accounting for wealth inequality, are presented based on different labour supply models. The equilibrium welfare is measured using a Bernoully-Nash aggregate. An increase in the share of the VS-type agents implies a degrowth transition to a lower level of average consumption. Analysis of the equilibrium framework shows that degrowth, whereby average market-based consumption falls, improves the equilibrium welfare, assuming the VS-type agents have sufficient resources, enabling a reduction in labour supplies. Sharing, collaborative consumption and basic income support welfare-increasing degrowth. Any growing economy can eventually reach the size at which degrowth would improve the welfare. Simulations suggest that degrowth can also yield a Pareto-improvement in welfare.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.02.007,"An Equilibrium Framework for the Analysis of a Degrowth Society With Asymmetric Agents, Sharing and Basic Income"

16.982924,-9.128533,4,"This paper aims to critically evaluate the theoretical foundations of income measurement on the basis of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In addition, the paper seeks to develop an accounting treatment for corporate social expenditure. A description on how Sudan Tax law of 1986 provides for corporate social responsibility was also presented. A critical approach was adopted to assess the relevant literature and to review the prevailing state-of-the-art of accounting and reporting for CSR. In most cases wages are determined by the employer.  A corporation may pay wages for its labor half of that paid by comparable firms and report a higher income. Furthermore, a corporation which failed to protect the environment from the negative consequences of its economic activities could also report a higher income compared with other environmentally responsible firms. Therefore, the net income of the former type of corporations could not be related entirely to a good economic performance. The paper argues that, the failure of a firm to meet the CSR will render its reported net income as nonethical.  How to report the cost of CSR in the balance sheet is still a debatable issue. No consensus was reached on whether the cost incurred by a corporation to prevent or mitigate the consequences of its economic activities be treated as a capital or revenue expenditure. The paper suggested an accounting treatment for capital expenditure of CSR on the basis of similar treatment approved by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).",https://doi.org/10.5897/kujms2015.0002,An ethical trend in income measurement; a critical review of the theoretical foundations of income measurement

It reviews some of the administrative problems that affected the policy process. It is rare to find a commentary concerning the SSI program that does not emphasize the sleeper quality of the legislation that federalized the adult assistance programs of aid to the aged, blind, and disabled. During the planning and early implementation phases of the program, social welfare planners and practitioners dealt with the substantive as well as the administrative nuances of SSI, acknowledging that the minimal congressional debate on the measure did not reflect the magnitude of change which it mandated. An extremely sparse legislative history exists around SSI, reflecting the program's entrapment in the rhetoric of the congressional debate centered on the family assistance plan.",https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-756850-8.50015-5,THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SSI: GUARANTEED INCOME OR WELFARE?

It finds that families in this situation often face an unstable or uncertain world, including unstable work and for some the uncertainties of privately rented housing, and that they greatly value stability. It identifies factors that help or hinder family well-being, including health conditions, the availability of extended family support and whether there is a background of debt. In considering how they deploy family budgets that are insufficient to cover all the items agreed as essential in the MIS research, the study found that parents prioritise children’s well-being over their own to a considerable degree. It also identifies ways in which family needs are served differently when resources are limited, such as spending more on recreation within the home when external activities are unaffordable.",,Falling short: the experiences of families living below the minimum income standard
15.916603,-26.84545,0,"Poverty and rising income inequality in Canada have brought demands for improved government action on redistribution. Unfortunately, such pleas risk being overshadowed by a looming fiscal crunch as the baby boomers retire. An expanding population of seniors will add at least one percent annually to both growing health and OAS/GIS costs so that, absent meaningful change, other spending will have to be slashed by an average of 20.2 percent by 2032 if total spending and revenues are not to rise relative to GDP. For Canada’s tax-transfer system to keep fulfilling its redistributive role, a fundamental rethink is required. With non-seniors spending being squeezed, some changes in tax mix, moderate revenue increases and refined targeting of transfers will be needed to protect the system’s progressive nature. Increasing personal income tax and reducing property tax by an offsetting amount would improve redistribution without raising taxes. More revenue could be obtained without severe distortions via a capital transfer tax, the elimination of boutique credits aimed at niche beneficiaries, or perhaps a dual income tax which exacts more from labor than capital income. Improvements to existing transfer programs are another way forward. The conversion of EI to a purely insurance basis, freeing up funds to support redistribution via refundable credits is a possibility. Another cost-saver involves removing the indexation of the OAS/GIS income threshold and allowing its real value to decline, making more recipients subject to clawbacks. Whichever course governments pursue, revamping Canada’s taxtransfer system will be a delicate and difficult task.

The present study attempts to narrow this evidence gap and aims to shed light on long‐run economic, budgetary and fiscal effects of selected education and employment policies for the inclusion of the marginalised Roma in the EU. We employ a general equilibrium approach that allows us to assess not only the direct impact of alternative Roma integration policies but also to capture all induced feedback effects. Our simulation results suggest that although Roma integration policies would be costly for the public budget, in the medium‐to‐long run, economic, budgetary and fiscal benefits may significantly outweigh short‐ to medium‐run Roma integration costs. Depending on the integration policy scenario and the analysed country, the full repayment of the integration policy investment (positive net present value) may be achieved after 7 to 9 years.

The first study suggests that the real minimum income benefit levels increased in many OECD countries whilst minimum income replacement rates declined on average. The increased benefit levels reflect policy changes while the declined replacement rates do not reflect benefit cuts but larger wage increases. The second study shows that globalization, soaring levels of unemployment and trade unions have triggered social assistance and minimum income benefit reforms. The third study indicates that the Lisbon Strategy has been positively associated with minimum income benefit developments since 2005. The findings in the fourth study suggest that in China, minimum income benefit programs vary considerably across regions and the benefit generosity has been increasing over the decade although still at low levels in an international perspective. The fifth and sixth studies focus on the indicator of income polarization to analyze income distribution. The fifth study shows that income polarization is stable in European countries and Europe as a whole.

(DG). The use of renewable resources to provide energy close to the end users has changed
the perspectives for the future power system. The traditional model of central generation, away
from most of the consumers, is not seen as the only solution for energy generation in big scale
anymore. This fact can affect citizens positively and create improvements for society,
especially for those who belong to social classes with low earnings.
The present study contributes to the evaluation of the potential economic and technical
benefits that distributed generation can create to low-income households. First, it presents the
economic benefits detailed in the literature and case studies of different countries of the world.
It also evaluates the financial impact of electricity non-technical losses in Brazil. After that, it

DG in low-income communities can create, including the reduction of commercial losses, and
alternatives to allow viable financing.
Assessments of the benefits that DG can create for low-income consumers are scarce,
but the case studies presented in this work show relevant results regarding that matter.
Besides that, this study indicates that the development of DG in low-income communities of
Brazil could generate relevant economic and technical benefits, and it could work as an
