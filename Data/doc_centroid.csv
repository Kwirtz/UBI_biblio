-29.921707,5.040028,Period3,"In November 2007, the Universal Declaration of Emergent Human Rights was approved at the Universal Forum of Cultures in Monterrey, Mexico. Article 1.3 reads: The right to a basic income or universal citizen’s income that guarantees to every human being, independently of age, gender, sexual orientation, civil or employment status, the right to live in material conditions of dignity. To this end, a regular cash payment, financed by tax reforms and covered by the state budget, and sufficient to cover his or her basic needs, is recognized as a right of citizenship of every member-resident of he society, whatever his or her other sources of income may be. The importance of article 1.3 of the Monterrey Declaration lies, first of all, in the fact that, rather than speaking of the right to subsistence, or of having certain minimal vital needs covered in case of the onset of poverty or some catastrophe, it specifically upholds the “right to a basic income or universal citizen’s income” as a guarantee to every single individual of the “right to live in material conditions of dignity.” This is tantamount to pledging that no individual will be excluded from the possibility of engaging in social life and exercising his or her rights and duties as a citizen because of acute poverty.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137265227_6,East Timor and Catalonia: Basic Income — Proposals for North and South,https://openalex.org/W2501628138

This, they argue, justifies placing a minimum work requirement on welfare recipients. This article seeks to rebut their claim. It begins by rejecting the attempt to ground the work requirement on a civic obligation to work. The article then explores the principle of reciprocity, and argues that the practice of reciprocity depends on the particular conception of distributive justice adopted. An examination of different interpretations of egalitarian justice and their corresponding patterns of reciprocity demonstrates that unconditional welfare benefits are compatible with, and sometimes even warranted by, the principle of reciprocity. Thus, imposing a work requirement on welfare recipients is by no means a mandate of reciprocity.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1470594x05056607,Unconditional welfare benefits and the principle of reciprocity,https://openalex.org/W2150410972

In this setting one of the most vibrant proposals is to replace or supplement existing social protection systems with a universal basic income (UBI). The chapter reflects on how a UBI does and should relate to analogous efforts within the framework of international human rights law. It argues that UBI offers a bold and imaginative solution to pressing problems that are about to become far more intractable as a result of the directions in which the global economy appears inexorably to be heading. While there are many objections relating to affordability in particular, the concept should not be rejected out of hand on the grounds that it is utopian. In todayâ€™s world of severe economic insecurity, creativity in social policy is necessary. The chapter concludes by calling for the debates over social protection floors and a UBI to be brought together, rather than being kept largely separate in a counter-productive and ultimately self-defeating way.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3079907,Universal Basic Income as a Social Rights-Based Antidote to Growing Economic Insecurity,https://openalex.org/W4229646519

Drawing on theories of labor decommodification, market socialism, and social reproduction, as well as more public-facing debates over policy, the purpose of this analysis is to better clarify the stakes a burgeoning left politics might have in pursuing the demand for UBI. Following key justifications put forward by chief proponents of the Wages for Housework movement for pursuing seemingly impractical, impossible, and politically ambiguous demands, I argue that UBI is best treated as a political perspective with both reactionary and revolutionary undercurrents.

In this chapter we analyse the preferences for an Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) among a large, representative sample of people in the 28 member states of the European Union (EU). The survey data were collected by online sampling on mobile devices in March 2017. We apply a multi-level ordered logit model and a fixed effects model. On average, almost three-quarters of the people in the EU stated to (probably) vote for the introduction of UBI, if there would be a referendum on introducing UBI. Half of the voters would like to see UBI being introduced after successful experiments in their own country or abroad; one third as soon as possible. The likelihood to vote in favour of UBI varies significantly between groups of people. The effect of awareness on preferences is inconclusive. The national macro-economic and welfare state contexts have significant effects. ""It reduces anxiety about financial basic needs"" is considered the most convincing argument for UBI. ""It might encourage people to stop working"" is considered the most convincing argument against UBI. The self-enhancement hypothesis is confirmed.

It would enhance economic growth, employment and general welfare. A basic income would serve as a compensation for diseconomies of small scale production; as incentive for new firms; as an alternative to complicated and often ineffective present subsidies and other measures for small business.

Less radical versions of negative income tax are also costed, incorporating the possibility of varying tax rates, the tapering out of tax credits, and placing some restrictions on the granting of tax credits. This makes negative income tax look more feasible. The analysis does not incorporate behavioural responses.

The experiment, implemented in 2017–2018, aimed to improve citizens’ employment and well-being by reducing the eligibility conditions of basic social benefits and by increasing monetary incentives to find employment. The data on attitudes come from responses to a survey carried out during the experiment. Identical questions were posed to the treatment (receiving the BI) and the control group of the experiment. The contributions of this paper are (1) an estimation of the relationship between participation and opinions on BI, (2) an analysis of the heterogeneity of the relationship and (3) an estimation of the relationship between participation and people’s ability to express their opinions on BI. Our findings indicate that participation in the experiment significantly explains people’s support for a BI and their ability to express opinions.",https://doi.org/10.1017/ics.2020.14,Speaking to those who know it best: Does participation in an experiment explain citizens’ attitudes to basic income?,https://openalex.org/W3047484864

Although the changes have often been more piecemeal than revolutionary, their cumulative effects are profound. The authors characterize the changes that have taken place as involving the institutionalization of new forms of dualism and argue that what gives contemporary developments a different character from the past is that dualism is now explicitly underwritten by state policy. They see this outcome as the culmination of a sequence of developments, beginning in the field of industrial relations, moving into labor market dynamics, and finally finding institutional expression in welfare state reforms. Contrary to theoretical accounts that suggest that institutional complementarities support stability and institutional reproduction, the authors argue that the linkages across these realms have helped to translate employer strategies that originated in the realm of industrial relations into a stable, new, and less egalitarian model with state support.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329209357888,Institutionalizing Dualism: Complementarities and Change in France and Germany,https://openalex.org/W2157441223

To illustrate these issues Haagh employs an Institutional Political Economy (IPE) lens to identify how the integrity, feasibility, and effects of Basic Income hinge on wider conditions.

We compare the effects of implementing a basic income on different types of employees concerning their consumption preferences. We show that, even in the neoclassical labour supply model without intrinsic work motivation, an unconditional basic income increases the participation rate in the labour market.

Macroeconomically, the JG works as an automatic countercyclical stabilizer and an excellent tool for aggregated demand management, ensuring the economy is continuously operating at full capacity. On top, the JG uses an employed buffer stock approach as a superior means to maintain price stability. Next to its favourable macroeconomic impacts, the JG offers many social benefits, particularly related to continuous employment, working conditions in the private sector, power relations in the labour market and democracy. While the JG and Universal Basic Income (UBI) are often discussed as comparable, competing policy proposals, the JG addresses more macroeconomic and social issues than the UBI does.

Areas of theory reviewed include the models of disability underlying political science theories, disability rights as a social and political movement, models of disability public policies, and theories of justice that address disability. The article concludes with a summary and analysis of relationships among the current areas of political science theories related to disability and their future implications for the understanding of human behavior and the social environment.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10911350802619870,Political Science Theory and Disability,https://openalex.org/W1991576356

As explained in the first part of the paper, this theory takes everyday social roles to be the primary subject-matter of the theory of justice, and it takes justice in these roles to be a matter of the kind of freedom that is available through their performance, namely ‘social’ freedom. The paper then identifies the key criteria of social freedom. The extent to which the introduction of an UBI would meet these criteria is then examined, with a focus on the social role that stands to be most affected by an UBI, namely that of the worker-earner. It is argued that while an UBI is likely to be only partially effective as an instrument of specifically social freedom, its main justification lies not here, but in securing a basis for the subjective freedom that social freedom presupposes.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13698230.2019.1585152,"Basic income, social freedom and the fabric of justice",https://openalex.org/W2915099249

In this essay, this rough conjecture is first presented, and its plausibility probed, on the background of some stylised facts about the rise of modern welfare states in the postwar period. Next, the focus is shifted to the current debate on the introduction of a basic income, a completely unconditional grant paid ex ante to all citizens. It is argued that if basic income is to have a chance of meeting the strong twofold condition stipulated in the conjecture, some major changes are required in the way one usually thinks about justice and efficiency in connection with social policy. But once these changes are made, as they arguably must be, the chance that basic income may be able to meet the challenge is greatly enhanced.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400017827,The Second Marriage of Justice and Efficiency,https://openalex.org/W2003199800

One common objection to BI has been that it is impossible to design a scheme that simultaneously conforms to these two criteria. In this article, I develop a conceptual framework for analysing the trade-offs that afflict BI policy design. I suggest that while the idea of a policy dilemma between affordability and adequacy does indeed afflict ‘full’ BI schemes, it is possible to design an affordable and adequate ‘partial’ BI scheme. However, this comes at the cost of (at least partly) forfeiting some key advantages that motivate interest in BI in the first place, since these only arise as a consequence of the elimination of means testing and related conditionality from the welfare system. Thus, BI proponents face a three-way trade-off in policy design between affordability, adequacy, and securing the full advantages of BI as a radical simplification of existing welfare policy. The trilemma is illustrated with reference to original microsimulation evidence for the UK, which demonstrates that at most two of the three criteria can be achieved in a single scheme.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279419000424,"A Basic Income Trilemma: Affordability, Adequacy, and the Advantages of Radically Simplified Welfare",https://openalex.org/W2955590095

The crisis had large repercussions for the welfare of many citizens and it generated cutbacks in virtually all social policy programmes. This halted a welfare‐state expansion that had been going on for decades. It also caused great concern about the state of welfare of the nation. In 1999 the Swedish Government appointed a ‘Welfare Commission’, a team of academic researchers who were assigned the task of drawing up a balance sheet for the development of welfare in the 1990s. The Commission delivered its final report in October 2001. This article is a condensed account of one of the more central issues for the Commission; namely, how the unemployment crisis affected already socially and economically vulnerable groups. Looking at the development over the entire decade, three groups stand out as particularly disadvantaged in terms of individual welfare resources: young adults, immigrants and single mothers. The downturn for these groups was especially accentuated in terms of employment and income. Young people and immigrants trying to get into the labour market during the crisis years faced the problems of newcomers to the systems of social protection. The poor economic development for single mothers could essentially be attributed to the shortage of work in general and of full‐time work in particular that followed from the unemployment crisis. As a consequence, the importance of selective benefits increased and the relative size of all public transfers – despite rationing measures – stayed fairly unchanged. The results highlight the great influence of macroeconomic conditions and policy making for the welfare of vulnerable groups in society.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-2397.00249,Welfare and the unemployment crisis: Sweden in the 1990s,https://openalex.org/W2127881275

I argue that the best strategy for UBI-advocates is to admit that ‘slackers’ should be merely tolerated as non-deserving recipients, because the UBI-policy will otherwise have good effects.

The decisive variable is the effect of labour automation, which increases economic insecurities globally, leaving some nation states in a position to cope with this and others not. The insecurities will increase migratory pressures on one hand but also justify the introduction of basic income on a nation state level on the other. The normative guideline is the republican conception of freedom as non-domination. This is used to justify a basic income, analyse how labour automation creates dominating structures and how borders dominate migrants seeking to move to countries which introduce a basic income. The result is that nation states that introduce a basic income to counter internal domination through labour automation, also have to look outside of their nation state. The imposition of borders in order to keep a basic income sustainable as well as labour automation itself, establish a form of domination over less developed countries and thus demand international regulation.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2020-0027,"Basic Income, Labour Automation and Migration – An Approach from a Republican Perspective",https://openalex.org/W3102209511

Basic income can play a crucial role in fostering such capacity. Because of its unconditionality, and thanks to bargaining power deriving from it, basic income is a sort of income that is convertible in terms of (a) time to conceive of (and put into practice) projects of one’s own, be it individually and/or collectively; (b) a capacity to explore alternative options and take promising risks; and (c) the right to credit, in the twofold sense of the right to financial resources and the right to social trust.

As a superior justification of basic income, I propose William James’ social ethics: it uses listening, experimentation, and revision as foundations for ethics; it acknowledges the personal, social, and cultural forces in selfhood; and it recognizes that all activity is valuable in the creation and maintenance of cultural norms and habits.

6.562243,-9.516473,Period3,"Contemporary egalitarianism has largely developed in abstraction from the basic fact that time passes, people age, and so any given society comprises several overlapping generations. As a result, few normative tools are available to assess claims made about the fairness of time-sensitive distributions. The field of intergenerational justice has emerged to fill this gap, but its theorists have primarily focused on the question of what we owe to future generations. My thesis contributes to egalitarian thought and intergenerational justice by providing an egalitarian account of justice between co-existing generations. It answers the question of which inequalities between age groups, on the one hand, and birth cohorts, on the other hand, matter; and it offers a framework to establish what counts as a suitably egalitarian treatment of young people.
The thesis is in two parts: the first establishes the theoretical framework, and the second makes explicit its implications for two policy discussions. In Part I, I highlight the generational implications of the dominant diachronic view of equality through time – complete lives egalitarianism (CLE). While it provides key insights into birth-cohort justice, CLE cannot account for why some cases of age-group inequalities are unjust. I then propose two complements to CLE to overcome its limitations: a prudential diachronic approach grounded on Daniels’s theory of age-group justice, and a synchronic alternative inspired by McKerlie’s work. From the first three chapters, I derive three principles of equality between overlapping generations: (1) approximate cohort equality, (2) prudential lifespan planning (lifespan sufficiency and efficiency), and (3) relational synchronic equality. I then draw on these principles to establish what ‘treating the young as equals’ means. In Part II, I put forward an intergenerational egalitarian case for basic income. I then consider whether we should be concerned about the absence of young people in parliaments, and propose the introduction of youth quotas.",,Treating Young People As Equals: Intergenerational Justice in Theory and Practice,https://openalex.org/W1490165506

But a more sensible move for improving the effectiveness of Canada’s social safety-net system may be to actually lower the age below 65 and rely strictly on an income test instead, regardless of age. The government could go a lot further toward the reduction of poverty in Canada by building on the success of its income supports for seniors, and making them available to poor Canadians of all ages. Canada can boast of having one of the lowest rates for poverty among seniors in the world, largely due to its guaranteed income programs for those 65 years and older. When low-income Canadians turn 65 years old and leave behind low-paying, often unstable jobs, their poverty levels drop substantially. What a guaranteed income provides, that their vulnerable job situation did not, is a form of protection against budget shocks — a sudden volatility in income or expenses without the access to savings or credit to smooth things out until stability returns. A guaranteed income provides a kind of “disaster insurance” that can protect someone in a crisis situation from going without necessities such as food or even shelter. Statistics show that the rate of Canadians experiencing “food insecurity” — that is, lack of access to food because of financial constraints — is half that among Canadians aged 65 to 69 years than it is among those aged 60 to 64. Self-reported rates of physical and mental health improve markedly as well after lowincome Canadians move from low-wage, insecure employment to a guaranteed income at the age of 65. That dramatic shift in physical and mental health indicates that expanding guaranteed income programs to younger Canadians is more than a simple cost calculation: there are potential savings to be found as poorer Canadians, given a guaranteed income, become healthier and therefore reduce the burden on the public health-care system. Canadian governments already spend billions of dollars on the downstream effects of poverty, but scant emphasis is put on programs targeting poverty’s roots. There is no evidence, where smaller-scale experiments have been tried, to show that a guaranteed income program creates a serious problem with negative incentives and discourages people from working who otherwise might. But because this is a common worry with working-age guaranteed income eligibility, phasing in the program gradually, by lowering eligibility a few years at a time, will allow ongoing investigation and analysis of the effects, before the program is rolled out on a large scale. The tremendous impact that guaranteed incomes have had on reducing poverty and improving health among seniors is something for which Canadians can be rightly proud. So much so that it is incumbent upon us to investigate whether Canada could use the same policy tools to drastically reduce poverty and improve health among Canadians of all ages.",,How a Guaranteed Annual Income Could Put Food Banks Out of Business,https://openalex.org/W3121319590
-10.9578,-6.893006,Period3,"Regarding the prospects of a transformation of income-security programmes into a universal and unconditional minimum income scheme, Belgium and the Netherlands are of particular interest. Since the early 1980s, one can find in the ‘low countries’ some of the most prominent proponents of a basic income (BI), i.e. “an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement” (Van Parijs 2000). In no other advanced welfare state the BI debate has been so broad and lively than in the Netherlands. Since 1975, the idea of a basisinkomen has been discussed within many Dutch political parties, trade unions, social organisations, and even at the governmental level. It was at the core of various official reports that progressively increased its respectability in political circles. Belgian political actors have always been more reluctant to it, with the noteworthy exception of the two green parties. But the academic discussion has been quite extensive. The founding congress and second international conference of the Basic Income European Network (BIEN) were held in Belgium, respectively in 1986 and 1988. In 1999, a Belgian political formation named ‘Vivant’ was launched as the first European single-issue party entirely focused on BI. Although it remains a tiny player in Belgium’s political game, it managed to attract public attention on the proposal through eye-catching posters in the country’s main cities. In this chapter, I will scrutinise the political chances of BI in the low countries and the probability of incremental steps into that direction. In the Section 1, assuming that a BI would replace most existing means-tested minimum income schemes, I will briefly review the main social assistance programmes of both countries. I shall try to demonstrate that a paradigm shift is underway which may at first sight seriously undermine the progress to a more universal and unconditional income-security system. In fact, as it is the case of many other European countries, Belgium and the Netherlands are in the process of restructuring their welfare states along ‘activation’ lines. Even if effective retrenchment remained limited to date, work requirements have been more strictly enforced with the passing years. Partly based on interviews and an extensive review of the press, Section 2 will be devoted to an account of more than twenty-five years of BI debate in both countries. The Dutch discussion already started in the mid-1970s, whereas the idea only appeared in 1985 in Belgium’s public debate. Even if the Dutch BI proponents were politically more powerful, in both countries the numerous BI advocates always failed to gain longlasting political support for their proposal. But in addressing questions of universality and conditionality, they managed to have an influence on the terms of the welfare reform discussions. Section 3 of this chapter will then focus on the very reasons of this failure to gain political support, which are of paramount importance for the future prospects of unconditional minimum income schemes. Starting from the hypothesis that under certain conditions a BI would be economically sustainable, most participants in the debate stress that four important obstacles have been in the way of the proposal. As is argued in some detail, the moral objection to an income by right without a related duty to work seems to be the most decisive impediment. Finally, in the conclusions I shall try to clarify why, given the obstacles and objections they encountered, most",,Basic Income in Belgium and the Netherlands: Implementation Through the Back Door?,https://openalex.org/W2304627525

8.185084,-9.702915,Period3,"Summary: Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been advanced to deal with a number of challenges. Seldom have trials of UBI been designed adequately to measure its impact on the health of participants across the spectrum of socioeconomic status. But the data that does exist suggests that policy has the potential to improve this aspect of people’s lives. Two theoretical frames have been advanced to explain this effect. The first is based, broadly, on its impact on behaviour, highlighting the ways in which present socio-economic conditions, including needs and means-based welfare systems, disincentivise healthy choices and activity. The second is based, broadly, on its impact on the endocrine system, holding that UBI serves to protect individuals from a range of stress-related illnesses induced by socio-economic conditions associated with hierarchy and inequality. While the absence of epidemiological input into designing trials means that these frames have yet to be tested, there are good sources of data from non-UBI-related studies that support their validity. This account lays out pathways to impact, demonstrates important points of consideration in the designing of trials and argues strongly for a trial on the basis of a transformative ‘upstream intervention’ capable of shaping the way that we deal with health. In that respect, we argue that, seven decades on from the creation of the NHS, UBI can be Labour’s next great and common-sense contribution to Britain’s health.",,The Health Case for Universal Basic Income:Supporting Document for The Labour Party’s Report on Universal Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2922941539

Although single mothers are disproportionately poor in all countries, there is even more cross-national variation in single-mother poverty than in poverty among the overall population. By far, the United States has the highest rate of poverty among single mothers among affluent democracies. The analyses show that single-mother poverty is a function of the household's employment, education, and age composition, and the presence of other adults in the household. Beyond individual characteristics, social policy exerts substantial influence on single-mother poverty. We find that two measures of universal social policy significantly reduce single-mother poverty. However, one measure of targeted social policy does not have significant effects, and another measure is significantly negative only when controlling for universal social policy. Moreover, the effects of universal social policy are larger. Additional analyses show that universal social policy does not have counterproductive consequences in terms of family structure or employment, while the results are less clear for targeted social policy.

Third, where the total amount of coercion is reduced by eliminating the hardship, the classical liberal state must do so as to fulfill its purpose.

This scheme involves every individual being associated with two bank accounts, an asset account (their own property) and a holding account (held in escrow).

The scheme enhances freedom, being neutral in relation to many other value systems, such as the secular/sacred spectrum.

This conclusion follows from a three-part argument. First, if a guaranteed income is in place, all individuals have the same opportunity to live without working. Therefore, those who choose not to work do not take advantage of a privilege that is unavailable to everyone else. Second, in the absence of an unconditional income, society is, in effect, applying the principle, (S)he who does not work, will not eat. If the application of this principle is to be consistent with reciprocity, it must be applied to everyone. Most modern industrial societies exempt many citizens from that choice. For example, the owners of external assets do not face the work-or-starve choice and do take advantage of a privilege that is not available to others. An unconditional guaranteed income is one way to eliminate that violation of reciprocity. Third, this paper addresses the criticism that the guaranteed income exploits middle-class workers by demonstrating that a basic income will have a positive effect on wages, which will at least partially counteract the effect of the taxes needed to pay for it.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329299027003004,Reciprocity and the Guaranteed Income,https://openalex.org/W2163944971

Historically, the concept has emerged from points across a wide political spectrum and the movement holds together a set of divergent political ideologies, which share the belief that the future might be simplified and secured by an economic floor. The universal basic income idea is, overall, profoundly performative, in that it attempts to model the ultimate pragmatism of wider social nets of generosity, and does so by representing the embodied conditions that might be brought into being by such generosity. In this way, the utopian heuristic of an unconditional, guaranteed income is said to be, in the words of Belgian political ethicist Philippe Van Parijs, an ‘instrument of freedom’ and a ‘device for economic sanity’.

First, we conducted a literature review to establish the concept of building a causal loop model of basic income with open innovation dynamics. Second, we built a causal loop model which includes basic income and all factors of open innovation dynamics. Third, we proved our causal loop model through a meta-analysis of global cases of basic income. Our research indicates that reflective basic income with permissionless open innovation, capital fluidity, a sharing economy, and a platform tax can motivate open innovation dynamics and arrive at a method by which an entrepreneurial state can conquer the growth limits of capitalism.",https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc5030041,Basic Income with High Open Innovation Dynamics: The Way to the Entrepreneurial State,https://openalex.org/W2958187471

We extend previous research on citizens’ preferences showing a link between job automation and demand for redistribution to the case of UBI preferences. Using European Social Survey data in 21 countries, we find no association between risk of job automation and UBI support. Our findings suggest that UBI and redistribution preferences differ in two important ways: First, opinion formation about UBI is still ongoing. Second, demand for UBI is lower than demand for redistribution, and traditional supporters of redistribution are sceptical about an UBI. This points to the multidimensionality of policy preferences.

Unconditional redistributive schemes do not take formal precautions to deal with potential motivational problems that may affect their stability. For example, they are designed to give people the freedom to decide whether or not to participate in the job market. However, scholars like Philippe Van Parijs and Simon Birnbaum think that the promotion of an ethos of justice can potentially do the necessary motivational work to secure the stability of unconditional redistributive institutions. Their solution lies in changing people’s behavior through an informal motivational mechanism rather than through a formal rule or institution. This paper argues against that ‘ethos-based solution.’ It presents three reasons to distrust that solution. First, it argues that even broader and more inclusive ethoi of justice can become oppressive and violate people’s freedom. Second, it suggests that the formal and informal strategies to generate that ethos may be difficult to implement, monitor, and control.

The demogrant has received surprisingly little scholarly attention, but this article locates it in Buchanan’s broader constitutional political economy project and shows it was a logical application of his theoretical framework to the problem of inefficient and unfair welfare systems when reform to the basic institutions of majoritarian democracy was not forthcoming. The demogrant aims to end the problems of majority cycling and rent seeking that plague contemporary welfare states and therefore offers a model of welfare without rent seeking—a constitutional welfare state. We compare Buchanan’s demogrant model to other universal basic income and negative income tax models and consider the most important criticisms. We conclude that rescuing the demogrant model from relative obscurity would be a fruitful future task of applied constitutional political economy and public choice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10602-020-09321-7,Welfare without rent seeking?

provision under which every member of society would be entitled to an income above subsistence level without means test or work requirement. The advantages of BI are that it effectively reduces poverty and increases the real freedom of citizens. However, by abolishing the necessity to work on the individual level BI policies are also inherently risky since they fundamentally change incentive structures. It is clearly possible that BI is fiscally infeasible in this sense that not enough people would engage in productive efforts on the basis of which a BI could then be distributed. Social science is to date unable to say how likely an outcome this is. From the perspective of BI supporters this state of affairs is suboptimal since the burden of proof on the feasibility of BI is widely perceived to fall on them. Basic income social experiments (BISE) are a very useful tool for meeting this strategic challenge. This is, firstly, because they are the best available method for generating knowledge on the consequences of a radically new programme such as BI. However, despite all methodological sophistication the social sciences can reduce but never eliminate the uncertainty regarding the consequences of BI, including fiscal feasibility. Secondly, BISE are useful because they help to overcome the discursive impasse which results from the fundamental lack of knowledge. BISE would help to move the currently stuck debate and – most importantly – show great promise for shifting the burden of proof back to the defendants of the status quo. Lastly, this paper finds ethical objections to BISE to be insubstantial and ascertains the feasibility of BISE in the German context.

The policies and institutions of developed welfare states obviously go a long way towards meeting this goal. But it is not clear that they go far enough. While preventing a good deal of deprivation, these policies and institutions are often targeted at relieving the symptoms of underlying asset inequality, rather than reducing this inequality itself. As such, they do not necessarily provide the less fortunate with the dignity and self-confidence that can flow from asset ownership (Bynner and Paxton, 2001). Moreover, such policies and institutions often come with conditions and requirements that limit the immediate freedom of action of those they assist.

The data collection utilized a multiphase sampling, and the interviews ( n =1004) were carried out on telephone to minimize selection-bias and produce demographically balanced data. Findings Over two-thirds (71 percent) of Finns do not expect technological unemployment to constitute a permanent problem in the digital economy. Nevertheless, 74 percent assume that technological unemployment will increase at least temporarily. A considerable majority (85 percent) also believe that future jobs will be more precarious. Younger generations, despite their currently weak position in the labor market, are surprisingly more optimistic in their predictions.

However, this weak average relationship masks considerable heterogeneity across countries.

I compare three potential ideal welfare regimes from a liberal-egalitarian perspective of justice: An ideal social democratic regime, a mixed regime containing a moderate UBI and a maximal UBI regime where UBI replaces most of the welfare state. These regimes are evaluated with respect to three aspects of justice performance: the scope and neutrality of opportunities provided, institutional complementarities with a dynamic, globalized economy and the policy feedback effects on the political stability of liberal-egalitarian political coalitions.

Providing an income to all its members on an individual basis, without means-test or the requirement to be in the labor market, BI offers every citizen access to a guaranteed income, regardless of marital or employment status. Despite the fundamental and universal importance of care, the responsibility of providing care and the necessity of receiving care have not been sufficiently recognized and rewarded during the development of welfare states. Providing care has been further problematized as during this development, eligibility for social security benefits has been connected to the employment status of claimants. It is expected, and is sometimes hoped, that BI will to some extent untangle the links between welfare and labor and enhance the recognition and valuation of a wide variety of unpaid activities, including care work, which are currently carried out mostly unpaid and largely by women. It is also expected that BI will address the problem of undervaluation of paid care work in the labor market. But what kind of impacts would BI as an innovative scheme for providing income guarantee have on care work? More specifically, by examining the process in which care work has become partly commodified, monetary remunerated and regulated by the government with the introduction of the Japanese Long Term Care Insurance Act (LTCI) in 2000, this chapter aims to investigate how BI would impact on restructuring the increasingly stratified Japanese care labor market.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137348081_8,The Impact of Basic Income on the Gendered Division of Paid Care Work,https://openalex.org/W2401356885

Unlike Western welfare-state regimes in which the politics of austerity has dominated, the politics of welfare expansion has been noticeable in East Asian welfare regimes. This paper will analyse whether these changes have fundamentally dismantled the productivist feature where social policy is subordinate to economic objectives. While the trajectories are different depending on different political institutional contexts, this study shows that there are two strong signs that these states are moving out of their productivist nature and also that they are in the process of establishing their own welfare states. Japan seems to still be a productivist welfare-state regime struggling to accommodate rapid socio-economic changes, whereas Korea is a welfare state regime with strong liberal characteristics via modern welfare politics. Since the needs for social policy expansion in China correspond to economic and political needs, the productivist feature has been significantly weakened. However, this study argues that these transitory welfare regimes are in critical stages of formulating their new welfare regimes and that welfare politics based on contingent events could affect the future trajectories of these regimes.",https://doi.org/10.1163/156853112x650827,End of the Era of Productivist Welfare Capitalism?

Secondly, the maintenance of the grant must also meet strict criteria. The demanding level of the grant must be effectively secured against reduction, allowing workers to plan on its long-term acceptability; and in order to avoid increased state domination it must assume the status of an entitlement rather than a gift that may be withdrawn, through stabilisation against political change or some other means.

A necessary condition for such changes would be to develop further fiscal and social welfare measures to promote an acceptable distribution of income. Unfortunately it is possible that two very desirable developments — namely, labour participation in decision-making in industry and the introduction of new technologies — may make this particular wage-fixing problem more, rather than less, acute. The reforms discussed to meet this problem cover: the use of Keynesian demand-management policies to keep the money national income on a steady but moderate growth path; measures to restrain the setting of monopolistic practices by trade unions; a system of national arbitration and a possible inflation tax to curb excessive wage increases; an integrated reconstruction of social benefits and direct taxation; the substitution of expenditure instead of income as the basis of a progressive direct tax; the possible introduction of an annual wealth tax; and the reform of capital transfer tax to fall progressively on the beneficiaries of gifts and bequests.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400013465,"Full Employment, New Technologies and the Distribution of Income",https://openalex.org/W2000121503

Point of departure is an economy with job scarcity. A fair way to deal with job scarcity is to grant everybody an equal right to work, where these rights can be freely traded. It turns out that such a Labour Rights scheme and a basic income scheme are equivalent. The equivalence is that the price of Labour Rights and the unemployment benefit corresponds to the income tax rate and basic income respectively. The tax rate can thus be considered as what workers have to pay to appropriate scarce job assets. Both schemes allow that some people voluntarily abstain from doing paid work, in return for a financial compensation. Therefore, the advantages in terms of equity and efficiency of a Labour Rights scheme equally apply to the basic income proposal. This analysis provides an argument against cutting unemployment and social assistance benefits during economic downturns and it offers new insights to evaluate the parasitism and exploitation objection raised against basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0770451800011489,"Basic income, unemployment and job scarcity",https://openalex.org/W3124720853

At the same time contributions to the National Insurance Fund increased significantly and continues to represent a substantial form of total social security revenue. The contributory principle has a broad public appeal, but National Insurance does not figure prominently in public debates and the system is poorly understood.

Flat rate pensions and widespread home ownership have ensured relative equality in older life. However, in response to perceived fiscal pressures generated by population ageing, Australia has increasingly shifted its policy settings, encouraging private savings over public risk pooling. Private savings are increasingly supported by public subsidy through tax policy. This has led to overlapping policy priorities, as public subsidies are used both as incentives to promote savings and as social policy instruments to promote adequate living standards in retirement. This conflict is evident in recent policy reviews of taxation, public spending and pension policy. This article explores the development of this conflict and how it manifests in proposals for reform.

The aim of this paper is to establish a relationship between the idea of an unconditional basic income and republican thought in general and the Swiss republican tradition in particular. I argue that Swiss republicanism bears a development potential that may provide a normative foundation for the introduction of an unconditional basic income.
Basic income can be justified on grounds of the conception of modern republicanism and its underlying ideal of freedom as non-domination. The Swiss republican tradition shows considerable affinity to this ideal of non-domination; its history can be read as a struggle against domination. In this sense, Swiss republicanism can be linked to the idea of an unconditional basic income. In contrast to other republican traditions in Europe, Swiss republicanism was able to develop and incorporate individualist values in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. Swiss republicanism still plays an important role in Swiss politics. The thesis that there still exists a relationship between Swiss republicanism and basic income will be corroborated by virtue of two examples: an old Swiss republican communal tradition that is still practised consists of disbursing an income that shows remarkable similarities to an unconditional basic income grant. Further, in contemporary Swiss social policy, the first pillar of the Swiss pension system bears considerable resemblance to the basic income idea. On the level of welfare regime research, one can even speak of a soft guarantism that prevails in Swiss social policy.
In Switzerland, a public discourse about the idea of an unconditional basic income has not yet developed. However, in order to inspire discourse, the link to Swiss republicanism could be emphasised. The pathway to the introduction of an unconditional basic income has begun in Swiss traditions already centuries ago. The prospect of further good development in the sense of freedom as nondomination in Switzerland should tie in with Switzerland's own past and tradition.",,Why Switzerland?

At the very heart of her social vision was the idea of distributing a universal allowance (basic income system) to all British citizens (children included).

Despite their inclusion in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and their articulation in the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the critics insist that the content of economic rights, their nature, and their relationship with other rights remain inadequately theorized. Moreover, persistent philosophical doubts – including objections to the alleged “positive” character of economic rights, questions about the purported interdependence and indivisibility of human rights, worries about the specificity of the obligations arising in connection with economic rights, and fears about the illimitable character of those obligations – render economic rights conceptually wobbly and politically precarious. It is true that theorists of social justice generally eschew rights-based approaches, though activists and advocates increasingly adopt the language of human rights in making their demands. And whether we attribute skepticism toward economic rights as primarily ideological or sincerely conceptual, there is no debating that economic rights remain “in question” in a way civil and political rights do not. In an era of rapid and profound social and economic transformation, and in a political context in which human rights are emerging as the dominant transnational normative discourse, it is urgent that we revisit the conceptual foundations of economic rights: the lack of theoretically sound and politically persuasive arguments for economic rights jeopardizes efforts to build momentum for humane, sustainable, and democratic economic priorities.",https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511511257.005,"“None So Poor That He Is Compelled to Sell Himself”: Democracy, Subsistence, and Basic Income",https://openalex.org/W22816034

In this article, we examine what it means for the state to institute a right to basic income. The normative literature on basic income has developed numerous arguments in support of basic income as an inextricable component of a just social order, but there exists little analysis about basic income within a jurisprudential or philosophical rights perspective. In our view, strong reasons of either a principled or a pragmatic nature in support of instituting a basic income scheme nevertheless often fall short of ascribing to basic income a distinctive Hohfeldian rights status. This article aims to partially redress this gap by examining two sets of questions. First, what are the implications – ethical and practical – of adopting basic income as a legal right as opposed to a mere policy? Second, we also enquire whether there should be such a right: what, if anything, is the ethical foundation that warrants granting basic income a distinctive legal rights status? This article suggests that any such foundation must be grounded in comparative evaluation and discusses several comparative strategies available to basic income advocates. The aim of this article is not to offer a definite argument in favor of a legal right to basic income, but to chart several lines of argument that a rights perspective might add to the contemporary discussion.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0191453715625439,Is there (or should there be) a <i>right</i> to basic income?,https://openalex.org/W2287627599

Historically, humans have contributed muscle and brains to production but we are now being outcompeted by machinery, in both areas, in many jobs.

It then presents simple, “back-of-the-envelope” estimates of the net cost of a UBI set at about the official poverty line: $12,000 per adult and $6,000 per child with a 50 % “marginal tax rate.” These back-of-the-envelope calculations present a greatly simplified UBI scheme meant not as a practical proposal but as a method to obtain a ballpark estimate of the cost of UBI in isolation. Even with simplifying assumptions, these figures are several times more accurate than many common but exaggerated estimates. Key findings of this study include the following. The net cost — the real cost — of this UBI scheme is $539 billion per year: about one-sixth its often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful gross cost of about $3.415 trillion. The net cost of this UBI scheme is less than 25 % of the cost of current U.S. entitlement spending, less than 15 % of overall federal spending, and about 2.95 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The average net beneficiary is a family of about two people making about $27,000 per year in market income. The family’s net benefit from the UBI would be nearly $9,000, raising their income to almost $36,000.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2017-0016,The Cost of Basic Income: Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations,https://openalex.org/W2619673714

This study quantitatively investigates what factors influence public attitudes toward implementing BI, taking the Hokuriku region of Japan as an example. The hypothesis and variables were designed based on the theories of retrenchment and social innovation, and a detailed consideration of the theoretical impacts of BI on human society, and of the social, economic and cultural characteristics of Japan. A questionnaire containing a BI proposal for Japan was developed, then a survey was conducted of 1028 local residents in the Hokuriku region. The logistic regression model was employed for the empirical analysis. The results showed that age, individual income level, family structure and interest in participating in non-market activities tend to influence respondents’ attitudes toward BI, due to concerns about the gains and losses from a trade-off selection between BI and the existing policies that it would replace. From the perspective of individual value, it was also found that the perception of the future vision of a society reshaped by BI also significantly influences public attitudes toward the policy. This research emphasized that the retrenchment of the existing policies accompanied by the implementation of BI lead potential beneficiaries of the current welfare system to weigh the change to their benefits, which consequently forms their attitudes toward BI.",https://doi.org/10.3390/soc10030052,"An Analysis of the Factors Influencing Public Attitudes toward Implementing Basic Income (BI) from an Individual Perspective: A Case Study of Hokuriku Region, Japan",https://openalex.org/W3042603186

This paper suggests two policy models of basic income that can be applied to Korea. The first model, the Basic Income Model I, combines basic income with national land holding tax. The Basic Income Model Ⅱ has a plan to procure the necessary revenue from land tax, environmental tax, and citizen income tax. If a basic income is introduced in Korea in the future, the actual policy should lie somewhere between Model Ⅰ and Model II. BR Our simulation results show that under Model Ⅰ, where the amount of annual basic income per person will range from 300,000 Won to 2,300,000 Won, 97% of the total households will become net beneficiaries of the policy. In contrast, the annual basic income will rise to 3,600,000 Won per capita with Model II, making 83% of the total households net beneficiaries. As the dividend per capita is greater in Model Ⅱ, the redistributive effect of income, which is shown in terms of the Gini-coefficient improvement, is much larger in Model Ⅱ than in Model I. Yet, because Model Ⅱ requires 185 trillion Won for its implementation, it seems politically less feasible to apply the Model II to the current Korean society.BR Even with the implementation of Model I, the softer model, we expect the following changes to take place in Korea. First, the propensity to seek rents will be reduced after the imposition of national land tax on all land owners. Second, inequality in land ownership will be mitigated and Chaebols and large enterprises will focus more on productive investments rather than on land speculation. Third, basic income raises the sense of entitlements among all citizens, which will lead to social inclusion and cohesion. Lastly, the welfare system will be reinforced and become more sustainable by granting dividend to the middle-class under the basic income system.",https://doi.org/10.38080/crh.2017.08.120.250,"Basic Income and National Land Tax in Korea : Background, Implementation Plans and the Estimated Effects",https://openalex.org/W2948758626

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has set up a working group to examine its implications, and four Scottish councils are hoping to launch pilot schemes.

This article identifies five waves of enthusiasm for basic income in Britain over the past century and highlights patterns of continuity and change. It shows that interest in the proposal has been greatest at times of pessimism about the future of the labour market, though concerns about the ethics and affordability of unconditional payments have always been difficult to shake. Advocates of UBI have also struggled to reconcile the technocratic approach of its Conservative and Liberal supporters with the transformative ambitions of the radical left.

-38.111988,5.016518,Period3,"In recent years, the welfare state has found itself unable to combat issues such as unemployment and poverty, forcing an ever-increasing share of the population to face an increasingly precarious existence. In light of this situation, a growing number of activists and academics have begun to embrace a new means for combating such issues, basic income. Basic income represents a radical departure from the current means of organizing welfare benefits, as an unconditional income granted to individuals without regard for means, age, or employment status. This thesis seeks to examine the potential effects of basic income with specific reference to the concept of social exclusion. 

In order to investigate the potential effects of basic income upon social exclusion, traditional quantitative or qualitative methods are not appropriate; therefore this thesis performs a conceptual analysis in relation to the concepts of basic income and social exclusion. To perform a conceptual analysis, a thorough understanding of each concept is first required. Basic income’s advocates justify the idea in many ways, ranging from arguments relating to its ability to provide true freedom to all to arguments viewing basic income as a means of challenging capitalism. Nonetheless, its critics remain, specifically in reference to its unconditional nature. Social exclusion, meanwhile, relates to the involuntary ability of an individual to participate in normal societal activities. Individuals become socially excluded through competition for resources and status within society, with the labor process playing the largest role in the creation of social exclusion.

The analysis of this thesis suggests that basic income has the ability to create a more inclusive society, in which fewer individuals suffer from social exclusion. Specifically, it appears to have considerable influence upon the labor process within society, and more broadly, the entire notion of work. Nevertheless, basic income does not seem to fundamentally alter the mechanisms that create social exclusion, leaving a small share of the population excluded even with a basic income. However, this thesis concludes by arguing that basic income appears to fulfill many of the goals of its advocates, and has the ability to combat social exclusion more effectively than current welfare policies.",,Can Basic Income Combat Social Exclusion?

Of the two proposals, however, Basic Income is likely to have the more profound effect on relative class power for several reasons: many people will “blow” their stakes either through bad luck or waste; basic income increases the possibility of engaging in decommodified, nonmarket activity, thus expanding the sphere of economic practices outside of capitalism; basic income increases the capacity of collective struggle by providing a guaranteed strike fund for workers.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329203261099,"Basic Income, Stakeholder Grants, and Class Analysis",https://openalex.org/W2157949926

We argue that investigators need not secure participants' informed consent when conducting government policy experiments if: (i) the government institution conducting or authorizing the experiment possesses a right to rule over the spheres of policy targeted by the research; and (ii) data collection does not involve the violation of participants' autonomy rights.",https://doi.org/10.1093/phe/phy015,Government Policy Experiments and Informed Consent,https://openalex.org/W2886465456

Van Parijs’ work constitutes the most ambitious attempt within the literature to ground a justification of BI within a systematic normative framework. In this paper I argue that key elements of his framework should form part of any progressive justification of BI. Specifically, his linking of the principle of ‘real freedom for all’ with the policy mechanism of the ‘highest sustainable basic income.’ I take issue with Van Parijs’ treatment of compensation for unequal internal endowments based on the criterion of ‘undominated diversity’ and I reject the ‘external resources’ approach to justifying the funding of a substantial BI, including Van Parijs’ ‘jobs as assets’ argument. I introduce the concept of ‘total social productivity’ as a means of understanding the production and reproduction of society in a manner that anchors the justification of BI in a commitment to a ‘deep form of social reciprocity.’ Finally, I suggest that BI be framed as a ‘pragmatic-utopian reform.’",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0022,Real Freedom for All Revisited – Normative Justifications of Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2668403398
-53.077843,1.6611124,Period3,"The article concerns the social theory of an unconditional basic income (a regular payment to each person regardless of their level of need or employment). The article points out that, during the last three years in Russia, the idea of a basic income has been actively discussed. This applies mainly to economists, whereas the author puts the question of a basic income in the context of Western social theory. In a situation of ever-accelerating changes that affect society (from technologicalization and automation to the reduction of social time), the world faces many global challenges. A basic income is one of them. The article highlights the reasons for the actualization of the topic of a universal basic income in contemporary social theory of the last ten years. These include automation, the transformation of the economy leading to changes in the types of employment, experiments on the implementation of a basic income in some countries, and most importantly, the discussion of “bullshitization”, which has happened to many jobs in the framework of contemporary financial capitalism (David Graeber). It reveals the understanding of a basic income by its key proponents and theorists (Srnicek, Williams, Van Parijs, Vanderborght, Ford, Graeber, Standing, and others), as well as the fact that freedom is often called as the main goal of a basic income implementation. The paper demonstrates that, in fact, we are mostly talking about the imperative of freedom, which is not always properly clarified. However, it does not matter how freedom is understood in the works of basic income theorists since it is unlikely to be realized in modern socio-economic conditions, and because current capitalism has mutated so much that it now uses the very fabric of human experience rather than labor as its raw material. In this context, talks about automation is more of a thought experiment, and therefore the discussion should be shifted to another perspective. Despite the fact that, according to the author’s case, a basic income is not entirely impossible in practice (and even perhaps not being desirable), it provides fruitful material for the development of contemporary social theory.",https://doi.org/10.17323/1728-192x-2020-2-198-224,Free Money in a Mousetrap of Surveillance Capitalism: Basic Income and Social Theory,https://openalex.org/W3038795267

This ideal does not seem like it can justify state‐mandated economic redistribution. For if one is externally free just as long as one can choose and act without being constrained by another, then only direct slavery, serfdom, or other systems of overt control seem to threaten external freedom. Yet Kant endows the freedom‐based state with considerable powers of economic redistribution. I argue that recent commentary has misunderstood both Kant's account of why poverty is a form of freedom‐threatening dependence and the extent of the Kantian state's powers for remedying poverty. Criticizing Arthur Ripstein and the Kantianism of the “Toronto‐School,” I argue that the most salient notion of dependence at issue within the Kantian framework is not the direct control of the choice‐making capacities of another but asymmetrical influence in a power relationship. For Kant, poverty is fundamentally a problem of structural disempowerment.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ejop.12331,Freedom and poverty in the Kantian state,https://openalex.org/W2790276528

We draw on work conducted in the Joint Learning Initiative on Children and AIDS's Learning Group 1: Strengthening Families, as well as published data and empirical literature to provide the rationale for family strengthening. We close with the following recommendations for strengthening families to ameliorate the effects of HIV and AIDS on children. Firstly, a developmental approach to poverty is an essential feature of responses to protect children affected by HIV and AIDS, necessary to safeguard their human capital. For this reason, access to essential services, such as health and education, as well as basic income security, must be at the heart of national strategic approaches. Secondly, we need to ensure that support garnered for children is directed to families. Unless we adopt a family oriented approach, we will not be in a position to interrupt the cycle of infection, provide treatment to all who need it and enable affected individuals to be cared for by those who love and feel responsible for them. Thirdly, income transfers, in a variety of forms, are desperately needed and positively indicated by available research. Basic economic security will relieve the worst distress experienced by families and enable them to continue to invest in the health care and education of their children. Lastly, interventions are needed to support distressed families and prevent knock-on negative outcomes through programmes such as home visiting, and protection and enhancement of children's potential through early child development efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09540120902923121,Strengthening families to support children affected by HIV and AIDS,https://openalex.org/W2132307643

These can be thought of as philosophical and microeconomic avenues of approach, respectively, and each is amply represented in this book. A somewhat less common framework for thinking about a BIG is to consider it as a macroeconomic policy. Examples of this approach include Mitchell and Watts (2004), who compare the macroeconomic consequences of a BIG to those of a job guarantee program, and Moutos and Scarth (2003), who consider the operation of a BIG in both an open and a closed economy. This chapter argues that the macroeconomic perspective is critical, given the dramatic and broadly distributed changes in household income resulting from a BIG, as well as its highly predictable structure. Most importantly for the purposes of this chapter, the fact that a BIG is a lump sum transfer guarantees that it has certain nondistortionary properties that are relevant for assessing its impact in an Austrian model of the macroeconomy.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137315939_4,The BIG as a Helicopter Drop “with Austrian Characteristics”,https://openalex.org/W2499358572

In a number of countries, such as Canada, Finland and the Netherlands, local experiments involving basic income have been taking place. This article addresses the main arguments for and against basic income. Some authors regard basic income as a populist and paternalist policy, which is an incorrect judgment, as its adequate implementation could lead to budgetary savings, reduce the size of government, and lower state interference in the lives of citizens. Another objection is that basic income would discourage labor and stimulate social dependency; however, local experiments in partial introduction of basic income and similar benefits have not confirmed this statement. The claim that basic income is too expensive of a measure does not consider that it is supposed to replace numerous other social benefits and would therefore most likely result in reduced administrative costs. Basic income is a social welfare measure most compatible with the nature of labor and the labor market under the technological revolution that has begun, where labor has been getting increasingly distributed and aimed at the workers’ self-realization rather than their survival. In practice, basic income is to be implemented gradually, only covering selected groups of individuals at first and expanding the range of recipients over time.

This paper addresses the question of whether income inequality is associated with the population prevalence of depression and, if so, the potential mechanisms and pathways which may explain this association. Our systematic review included 26 studies, mostly from high-income countries. Nearly two-thirds of all studies and five out of six longitudinal studies reported a statistically significant positive relationship between income inequality and risk of depression; only one study reported a statistically significant negative relationship. Twelve studies were included in a meta-analysis with dichotomized inequality groupings. The pooled risk ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07-1.31), demonstrating greater risk of depression in populations with higher income inequality relative to populations with lower inequality. Multiple studies reported subgroup effects, including greater impacts of income inequality among women and low-income populations. We propose an ecological framework, with mechanisms operating at the national level (the neo-material hypothesis), neighbourhood level (the social capital and the social comparison hypotheses) and individual level (psychological stress and social defeat hypotheses) to explain this association. We conclude that policy makers should actively promote actions to reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation policies and a basic universal income. Mental health professionals should champion such policies, as well as promote the delivery of interventions which target the pathways and proximal determinants, such as building life skills in adolescents and provision of psychological therapies and packages of care with demonstrated effectiveness for settings of poverty and high income inequality.",https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20492,Income inequality and depression: a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the association and a scoping review of mechanisms,https://openalex.org/W2787017245

This turn consists of the multiplication of measures aimed at bringing those who are unemployed closer to participation in the labour market. These measures often induce a strengthening of the conditions that must be met in order to receive social benefits. It is in this well known context that the authors gathered in this book decided to take a closer look at the relationship between activation policies for the unemployed and the right and the duty to work. If activation measures are likely to increase transitions towards the labour market, we can also make the assumption that they may, particularly when they are marked with the seal of coercion, hinder or dramatically reduce the right to freely chosen work. In such circumstances, the realisation of the «right to work», which is often stated to be the aim of those who promote activation, tends in practice to be reduced to an increasing pressure being exerted on the unemployed. In this case, isn’t it actually the duty to work that is particularly reinforced? After an historical and philosophical perspective on the issue, this assumption is confronted with the developments observed in the United States and in France, and then with the guidelines laid down in international human rights instruments.

It affirms the idea that as a matter of basic rights, no one should live in poverty in an affluent society.

Results from multi-level models suggest that a broader coalition of UBI supporters can generally be found in countries where social spending is low. Specifically, we find that welfare state chauvinism is more likely to be associated with negative attitudes towards a UBI in countries with high levels of spending, but has only a weak association with UBI support in low-spending countries.

The article describes these legislative changes and analyses the practical implications for migration as well as whether the changes have had a deeper impact on values in Swedish social security. The analysis shows that the Swedish legislator and courts are struggling to strike a balance between residence-based social security and free movement of persons. An early – and also a major – change was to turn the guarantee-level pension into a pro-rata scheme. To follow up the consequences of this, a special non-contributory benefit had to be introduced to prevent an inflow of applicants into social assistance.

However, the European social policy landscape today looks as varied as it did at any time during the 20th century. ‘New institutionalism’ seems particularly helpful to account for the divergent outcomes observed, and it explains the resistance of different structures to change through past commitments, the political weight of welfare constituencies and the inertia of institutional arrangements – in short, through ‘path dependency’. Welfare state institutions play a special role in framing the politics of social reform and can explain trajectories and forms of policy change. The institutional shape of the existing social policy landscape poses a significant constraint on the degree and the direction of change. This approach is applied to welfare state developments in the UK and France, comparing reforms of unemployment compensation, old-age pensions and health care. Both countries have developed welfare states, although with extremely different institutional features. Two institutional effects in particular emerge: schemes that mainly redistribute horizontally and protect the middle classes well are likely to be more resistant against cuts. Their support base is larger and more influential compared with schemes that are targeted on the poor or are so parsimonious as to be insignificant for most of the electorate. The contrast between the overall resistance of French social insurance against cuts and the withering away of its British counterpart is telling.

The first lesson Rawls took from Knight was that inheritance of talent and wealth are on a moral par. Knight highlighted the inconsistency of objecting to the inheritance of wealth while taking for granted the legitimacy of unequal reward based on differential productive capacity. Rawls agreed that there was an inconsistency, but claimed that it should be resolved by rejecting both kinds of inequality, except to the extent they benefitted the worst off. The second lesson Rawls learned from Knight was that the size of one’s marginal product depends on supply and demand, which depend on institutional decisions that cannot themselves be made on the basis of the principle of rewarding marginal productivity. The article claims that this argument about background justice overstates its conclusion, because the dependence of contribution on institutional setup is not total. Proposals for an unconditional basic income may therefore have a strike against them, as far as a reciprocity-based conception of desert is concerned.

It is a process of practically realisable transformative steps which together with their combined and mutually reinforcing effects enable more radical social changes beyond a mere reform. The author argues that these transformative steps have to address two conditions embedded in the institutionalised structures of late modern capitalist society: the limited understanding of meaningful work as paid employment; and the liberal ideal of the independent and autonomous individual. Whereas a UBI can challenge the first condition, a public model of care questions the second condition by shifting the primary responsibility of care from the family towards a social solidarity.

The author believes that this topic can become one of the most relevant for social-philosophical research. The author notes that although the problem has been of concern to philosophers and scientists for a long time, it has become especially relevant only recently – over the past ten years. The following reasons are given as an explanation: (a) recent experiments on the introduction of a universal basic income in Western countries, (b) the trend toward automation and technologization, (c) the transformation of the economy, which is becoming more and more precarious. The author notes that the topic of universal basic income has become relevant even in Russian science, however, not in social philosophy, as in the West, but mainly in economics. The author argues that, since the discussion about basic income in the economic dimension has already taken place, it should be expanded to the field of social philosophy. To do this, the author raises a number of questions that will shed light on the social-philosophical nature of the problem of universal basic income – freedom, justice, welfare state, etc. Special attention is paid to the curious ideological transformations that became possible by the emergence of topic of basic income.

Moreover, we summarize the empirical findings of quantitative and qualitative studies on the diffusion and transfer of social policy, from some pioneering studies to the latest findings. Against this background we point out what we believe to be promising avenues for future research.

Some years prior to the publication in 1989, similar proposals had been widely discussed in Great-Britain and Continental Europe under the name of ‘basic income’. Yet, in Meade’s writings the idea of a social dividend was not new. In fact, throughout his life, it regularly resurfaces in many books and articles at least since 1935. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it documents the appearance of ‘social dividend’ in the early writings of James Meade. It also discusses different discursive communities Meade was involved in and which might have been possible origins for the term as well as for the idea of an unconditional equal payment to all. Secondly, it shows that in Meade’s writings a ‘social dividend’ plays different roles, prefiguring in a sense different approaches to ‘basic income’ in the present-day literature.

Many of the sweeping reforms carried out under the banner of the “Common Sense Revolution” received widespread coverage: for example, reductions in welfare rates, the introduction of the Ontario Works programme, the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy for so-called welfare fraud, and changes to the rules relating to common-law spousal relationships. However, much less attention has focused upon significant changes to the ways welfare is delivered. This paper critically interrogates a number of key changes to the Service Delivery Model in Ontario. After the passage of federal legislation in 1995, national entitlements to welfare have been terminated, replaced with local responsibility; this decentralization is changing not only the hierarchy of the regulation of poor people, but also the form and function of provision. In particular, there is evidence of the reinvention of administration towards the micro-regulation of job search and personal behaviour and the deterrence of welfare receipt as applicants and recipients are bureaucratically disentitled.

Effective redistribution, they argued, resulted less from a Robin Hood logic – taking from the rich to give to the poor – than from a broad and egalitarian provision of services and transfers. Hence, the paradox: a country obtained more redistribution when it took from all to give to all than when it sought to take from the rich to help the poor. Recent studies, however, failed to confirm the existence of this paradox. This article suggests that the original argument was theoretically sound but inadequately operationalized. Korpi and Palme measured universalism indirectly, not by the design or character of social programmes, but rather by their outcomes, namely, by their income effects. These outcomes, however, are influenced by exogenous factors. We use two new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicators to capture universalism directly, through the institutional design of social programmes: (1) the percentage of social benefits that are means or income tested and (2) the proportion of private spending in total social expenditures. These two indicators are combined into a universalism index and tested with a time-series cross-sectional design for 20 OECD countries between 2000 and 2011.

Two progressive proposals for ending poverty and promoting personal development and freedom are then compared using this assessment criterion. The first proposal is that society guarantee everyone an unconditional basic income (BI) without imposing work requirements in exchange for the guarantee. The second proposal is that society use direct job creation to provide employment assurance (EA) for anyone who is unable to find decent work in the economy’s regular labor market. The cost of equally expansive versions of the two strategies is compared along with their ability to achieve other policy goals. It is argued that a BI guarantee would be far more expensive than the EA strategy as a means of securing the right to income recognized in the Universal Declaration, that a BI guarantee would not provide an adequate substitute for securing the right to work, and that most of the other benefits a BI guarantee would produce could be better achieved at less cost by using the EA strategy supplemented by conventional income transfer programs. Based on this analysis it is argued that efforts to promote the BI idea as a solution to the problems of unemployment and poverty in market societies should be rejected. On the other hand, less expensive versions of the BI idea could make a valuable contribution to the design of income transfer measures as long as they were not treated as a substitute for policies designed to secure the right to work and income support recognized in the Universal Declaration.

Marx’s critique of exploitation suggests two apparently opposed positions on a basic income. On the one hand, a basic income funded from taxes on labor would appear to be exploitative of workers. On the other hand, a basic income liberates everyone from the vulnerable condition in which one is forced to sell one’s labor in order to survive, and so seems to be one way of abolishing exploitation at its root. This paper will develop a conception of exploitation that resolves the conflict in favor of basic income. The conception of exploitation is grounded in a liberal egalitarian conception of justice rather than in Marx’s labor theory of value or an exclusive focus on the worker-capitalist relation. This position is not premised on an acceptance of the basic institutions of capitalism, but rather is a standpoint from which to evaluate them. It is not necessary to downsize our ideas of freedom and equality. But it is less obvious than it appeared in classic Marxist formulations that socialism is necessary for social justice.

However, existing literature does not sufficiently address the question of which factors are associated with individual support for a UBI. While a large literature in political economy has focused on individual preferences for existing welfare state benefits, it has not analysed the case of a UBI. Using the eighth wave of the European Social Survey (ESS), this article seeks to remedy this gap by analysing individual support for a UBI in 21 European countries. The findings from logistic regression analyses with country fixed effects are partly consistent with the expectations of previous social policy and political economy literatures. Younger, low-income, left-leaning individuals and the unemployed are more likely to support a UBI. Individuals with positive views of benefit recipients and/or high trust in political institutions are also more supportive, while anti-immigration attitudes are associated with lower support. By contrast, the patterns across occupations are mixed and male respondents appear slightly more supportive. Trade union membership is not statistically significant, perhaps because of contradictory effects: unions typically support new welfare state policies but they also have a key role in many existing welfare state schemes and may worry about individuals’ attachment to the labour market. At the cross-national level, support tends to be higher where benefit activation is more pronounced and unemployment benefits less generous. These results suggest one possible reason why countries with high support for a UBI have not introduced it: the mixed support among the left means a pro-UBI coalition has to draw on right-wing voters who may support it only with lower taxes and/or extensive replacement of welfare state benefits, which in turn may further alienate parts of the left.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0958928720923596,The political economy of individual-level support for the basic income in Europe,https://openalex.org/W3015310819

Synthesising Marxian form analysis with Marxist-feminist social reproduction theory, this article suggests that these crises relate to historically specific capitalist social forms: labour, money and the state. These separate but interlocking crises of social form are temporary and contingent expressions of an underlying, permanent crisis of social reproduction. Mistaking the pervasive crisis of social reproduction in its totality for a temporary or contingent trifold crisis of work, wage or social democracy, Universal Basic Income proposals seek to solve it by moving through the same social forms through which they take effect, rather than confronting the social relations that constitute their antagonistic undertow and generate the crisis of social reproduction. The article considers two other solutions proposed to handle the deeper-rooted crisis with which Universal Basic Income grapples: Universal Basic Services and Universal Basic Infrastructure. Both propose non-monetary ways past the impasses of the Universal Basic Income, addressing much more directly the constrained basis of individual and collective reproduction that characterises capitalist social relations. But they retain a link with capitalist social forms of money and state that may serve to close rather than open the path to real alternatives.

But the idea is a controversial one; progressive activists, academics, and politicians disagree about the desirability and the practicality of a guaranteed income.

As a starting place for discussion, the idea of a guaranteed income is used to signal reform proposals that advocate some variant of an income benefit scheme in which the state provides a minimum level of basic income on a continuing basis to every adult, irrespective of personal circumstances or need, with no or very few conditions attached.Proponents of a guaranteed income cite a range of reasons supporting the idea: A fix to poverty; Liberty and individual opportunity; Social and democratic citizenship; Gender equality; Shared social ownership; A flexible and just labour market; and Environmental sustainability.",,Possibilities and Prospects: The Debate Over a Guaranteed Income,https://openalex.org/W1520879396

4.320627,-11.893297,Period3,"Abstract The political economy literature has gathered compelling evidence that labour market risks shape political preferences. Accordingly, insecurity fuels support for redistribution and left parties. This article analyses this argument for temporary workers, a so far neglected risk category which has increased dramatically in the past two decades. Temporary workers also have been in the focus of recent insider‐outsider debates. Some authors in this line of research have argued that temporary work leads to political disenchantment – for example, non‐instrumental responses such as vote abstention or protest voting. This contradicts risk‐based explanations of political preferences. The article discusses both theoretical perspectives and derives conflicting hypotheses for the empirical analysis of temporary workers' policy and party preferences. The review reveals considerable ambiguity regarding the questions which parties temporary workers can be expected to support and what the underlying motives for party choice are. Synthesising arguments from both perspectives, the article proposes an alternative argument according to which temporary workers are expected to support the ‘new’ left – that is, green and other left‐libertarian parties. It is argued that this party family combines redistributive policies with outsider‐friendly policy design. Using individual‐level data from the European Social Survey for 15 European countries, the article supports this argument by showing that temporary, compared to permanent, workers exhibit higher demand for redistribution and stronger support for the new left. Neither the risk‐based nor the insider‐outsider explanations receive full support. In particular, no signs of political disenchantment of temporary workers can be found. Thus, the findings challenge central claims of the insider‐outsider literature.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12027,Labour market risks and political preferences: The case of temporary employment,https://openalex.org/W1580942943

While market failure provides a reason for mandatory participation in social insurance, it will not justify the generous (if conditional) income support egalitarians favour.

The most important objection to this argument available to Rawlsians is that basic income violates the demands of reciprocity, where reciprocity in any scheme of distribution is a requirement of justice. The second half of the paper addresses this objection. It is argued there that even if the objection can be made successfully by Rawlsians (and this is not clear), it is not sufficient to divest them of a commitment to basic income, given some practical considerations about the implementation of alternatives to basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-5930.00243,"Basic Income, Self‐Respect and Reciprocity",https://openalex.org/W1985507220

The author believes that the question of the future of labor should be reviewed in a social-philosophical perspective. The analytical potential of philosophical thinking can be useful in predicting the consequences of implementing the basic income initiative. The article proceeds from the premise that in the 21 st century the idea of basic income application turns from a utopian project into real measures roadmap. The economic well-being provided by the widespread use of technical means makes it possible to seriously plan the transfer of many workers employed in the sector of services and non-material production to basic income. The author points out that first of all it is necessary to assess the consequences of such a measure for the people. Traditionally, capitalist society has been built around a narrative that hard work is well rewarded. The opposition of labor and free time has shaped consumption patterns and life strategies for several generations. In the conclusion, the author suggests to consider whether, by removing such a system-forming element from the social structure, the society itself will be put under threat. It may turn out that an initiative aimed at changing society for the better will actually turn out to become a personal disaster for many people who will not be able to find a use for themselves in the new world, which is already not built around labor.

Our analysis also reveals a number of important political choices faced by policy makers and advocates intent on implementing an administratively efficient basic income policy. The absence of systematic administrative analysis in the basic income literature has obscured these hard choices.",https://doi.org/10.1332/030557311x546352,The administrative efficiency of basic income,https://openalex.org/W2004690677

However the case for open borders is weaker to the extent that global transfers (such as might occur with a regional basic income or global basic income) address the economic inequities and motives for migration. In the absence of such global or regional institutions, NBI advocates can justify border restriction and a waiting period for BI entitlement, to the extent necessary to prevent a worsening of the condition of the least advantaged compatriots, as temporary measures on a path toward global justice.",https://doi.org/10.2202/1932-0183.1001,Basic Income and Migration Policy: A Moral Dilemma?,https://openalex.org/W1989200283

It seeks to determine whether and to what extent the strength of cultural productivism can explain cross-national variation in public support for the implementation of UBI. Two main findings are reported. First, the results demonstrate that the public are less susceptible to supporting UBI in countries where average employment commitment is higher. Second, the results show that, even though employment commitment is a strong predictor of cross-national variation in the public support for UBI, the effect is surpassed and explained by GDP, which itself is negatively related to the outcome. The study argues that the capacity of UBI to appeal to the general public is limited by the prosperity of post-industrial societies, rather than by the cultural attachment of their populations to paid work.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14616696.2020.1758741,Cultural productivism and public support for the universal basic income from a cross-national perspective,https://openalex.org/W3023034484

29.810446,-1.0013937,Period3,"abstract When viewed as a question of distributive justice the evaluation of workfare typically reflects exclusively on the distribution of income: do the physically capable have a justified claim for state support, or is it fair to demand from those who do work to subsidise this support? Rarely is workfare appraised in terms of how it affects other parties such as employers or other workers, and on the structural effects the pattern of incentives it generates brings about, or as an issue of distributive justice related to a more extensive range of objects of distribution such as access to pleasing jobs. We propose to evaluate workfare by looking at its effects more broadly: (1) we discuss and dismiss on empirical grounds the two most common arguments in favour of workfare, namely that workfare develops self‐reliance among participants and it is more economical in the use of altruism among taxpayers. (2) We suggest that workfare focuses on work as a burden and as a means to income, ignoring other beneficial aspects that are conducive to the worker’s self expression. These other benefits are distributed unevenly between two main groups: the privileged well off and the disadvantaged. (3) we argue that workfare functions as a mechanism to preserve these privileges to one class of workers at the expense of another.

32.287468,0.2627851,Period1,"Unlike American proposals for welfare reform which are concerned primarily with reducing costs by altering work behavior among present recipients of public assistance, British attempts to devise an income transfer system are based on the rationale that scarce resources should be concentrated upon those in the greatest need. There is some concern about disincentive effects, particularly when people draw benefits from more than one program. This article describes the theory and operation of recent income supplement programs in Britain, the problems and anomalies of each, and the government's attempts to devise solutions. The British and American experiences are compared in the concluding section. The British interest in a reverse income tax, in common with the American interest, has been inspired by many motives. It does not appear, however, to have involved any primary concern for altering work behavior among present recipients of supplementary benefits (public assistance) by using income-conditioning of benefits as an incentive strategy. Rather, the hope has been that tax burdens and total government expenditures could be restrained through increased reliance upon selective policies. Those who could afford to pay more for the use of social services should accept higher user charges, while the poor should receive benefits based on a test of income. The underlying rationale has been that scarce resources should be concentrated upon those in greatest need. This strategy has therefore called for the gradual reduction of universal and general subsidies.

Like its predecessors, the Conservative government hoped to improve the value of cash benefits while increasing charges for services. As a result, the cost of school meals, which had been subsidized as part of a broader food subsidy, was increased. Similarly, in a major reform of housing finances, the Conservative government will increase rents in public Council housing to a level which approaches their market value. Charges in National Health Service programs for prescriptions, dental, and optical costs have also been increased. These increased costs strain the budgets of lower-income families. Therefore, special means-tested benefits, in the form of free school meals, rent rebates, or National Health Service exemptions, had to be extended to larger numbers of families to relieve the hardships that accompany the price increases in school meals, rent, and medical care. In addition to reducing general subsidies and relying upon different means tests for in-kind and earmarked programs, the government has sought a general cash supplement to aid the working poor, a group that public policy had neglected-but not altogether. One way to aid the working poor was by family allowances. A way of limiting the cost of increasing them within the framework of a universal scheme had been introduced by the Labor government. The scheme integrated any additional increases in direct expenditures for family allowances with a reduction in the value of tax exemptions for children. This system was known as claw-back. FROM CLAW-BACK TO FIS It may be useful to review briefly the operation of claw-back, because the means-tested Family Income Supplements (FIS) bill, which altogether abandoned a universal approach, emerged as a result of its limitations. Claw-back was introduced in 1968 as a way to concentrate additional benefits in family allowances selectively among the poor. It operated so that the standard-rate taxpayer, that is, a family paying 32 percent of its marginal taxable income on income tax, received virtually no benefit from these increases. At that time this included most of the British taxpaying public. This objective was accomplished by offsetting the proposed increase in family allowances with an equivalent reduction in the total personal tax allowance. In this way, the increase benefited in full those who were below the tax threshold and also benefited, at least in part, those reduced-rate taxpayers who were paying taxes below the 32 percent level. The 1968 increase of ?183 million in gross expenditures concentrated ?47 million on low income families paying below the standard rate. And much of the rest was recouped through taxation, since family allowances were subject to income tax.

Obtaining a sufficient citizenship-based income without work obligations is fundamentally opposing the foundations of the welfare systems that are in place nowadays. As BI has gained increasing attention in public debates and among policymakers, questions arise about its social legitimacy. This study is the first to analyse a broad range of explanatory individual and contextual factors that may affect popular support for BI. In addition, we study how BI support is related to support of current welfare provisions, to analyse how radically different people perceive a BI to be. We use a unique survey question – available for 23 European countries, from the recent release of the European Social Survey (2016) –that introduces BI with an extended definition, emphasizing its universal and unconditional character and that it will replace other benefits and services and is paid for by taxes. Results show relatively high, but varying levels of support among European countries and social groups. People who are in a more vulnerable socio-economic position support BI more, as well as political left-wingers, egalitarianists and people who support targeting benefits at the poor. Also, a BI is more supported in countries with higher levels of material deprivation. This pattern of relations on both the individual and contextual levels seems to suggest that it is not the universal character or its unconditionality that makes a BI so attractive to a large share of the European population, but the fact that it provides (poor) people with a guaranteed minimum income.

As with other policy areas, the effects of enhanced Treasury micro-management of the Government's reform agenda has begun to impact upon the field of planning. The prime example in this respect is the Treasury's preference for replacing state provision of welfare-enhancing services with the move towards an individualized system of asset-based welfare. The article begins with an analysis of this shift, showing how it is dependent on creating financialized economic agents who think instinctively as active saver-investors in their quest to accumulate assets to fund future consumption of welfare. In contemporary Britain the housing market dominates the accumulation of assets amongst everyday saver-investors. The article concludes by analysing the possible tension that will be introduced into the planning process because of New Labour's twin goals: (1) to defend the current value of asset wealth even as the mortgage lending market has stalled and confidence in the stability of house prices has temporarily evaporated; and (2) to restrict exclusion from private ownership in the housing market so that broadening access can be used to propel a universal move towards an individualized system of asset-based welfare.

Methods: Applying modified versions of the principles of UD to disability social policy and using core interpretative strategies for human rights implementation (used in the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) to illuminate, by analogy, ways to resolve the dilemma between seeking equality and respecting difference. Results: The aspirations of UD in architecture and planning – namely to design buildings and cities to accommodate the needs of the widest spectrum of abilities as possible – can successfully be applied to social policy that focuses on the needs and circumstances of persons with disabilities, and which underwrites a blueprint for reform in the delivery of social services. Conclusions: “Universal social policy”, and UD, are feasible and desirable approaches to their respective domains, if we adopt a strategy derived from the legal interpretation of human rights implementation. The consequence, however, may be a policy that begins a process of social disappearance of disability. Implications for RehabilitationThe well-recognised principles of Universal Design (UD) have analogs for social policy that focuses on the needs of persons with disabilities.Universal social policy is consistent with the rights and aspirations of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Universalising social policy may lead eventually to the disappearance of “disability” as a policy category.",https://doi.org/10.3109/09638288.2014.932447,Universally design social policy: when disability disappears?,https://openalex.org/W2076082726

In this chapter, I question the characterization of the PFD as either a basic income or a robust model for one. I argue instead that the PFD is a resource dividend, a form of redistribution that is related to, but not synonymous with, a basic income. While the ideas of basic income and resource dividends share some philosophical justifications and some roots in intellectual history, they are different enough that they ought not to be confused. Beyond a philosophical desire for semantic clarity, the distinction matters because the justifications for different forms of redistribution, both those justifications that are part of the popular understanding and those that have a more limited academic currency, affect their chances for implementation, their sustainability, and their vulnerability to political processes. In particular, it is possible to design resource dividends in ways that are incompatible with the goals of a basic income and that lead to outcomes in tension with, if not opposed to, its goals.

The upshot is basic income rests on developmentalism indirectly, as state-promotion of economic equality, cooperative public finance, and human development-oriented governing of core institutions all contribute to the feasibility of a BI reform.

That is, just as many countries already levy royalties on rent earned from extracting natural resources, one can think of the DST as a tax levied on economic rents earned by digital platform companies from particular locations. We provide stylized examples showing how rent earned by digital platforms can be traced to specific locations, even when users from multiple jurisdictions participate. We then elaborate the analogy between the DST and resource royalties, and analyze the DST’s economic incidence as well as its effect on consumer welfare using a simple model. Finally we explain why the DST’s significance goes beyond current concerns about multinational tax avoidance, in that it indicates directions for redesigning international taxation in the age of labor-replacing AI technology.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3321393,The Digital Services Tax as a Tax on Location-Specific Rent,https://openalex.org/W2950916492

Both countries share a colonial past, dispossession of the indigenous populations, and common features regarding the model of social protection that developed during the nineteenth and twentieth century. In comparative welfare state studies the two countries are often grouped together, along with the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, in what some scholars refer to as a “liberal welfare state” model. This welfare state model describes the strong preference for market-based solutions in meeting social needs (commodification), a residual safety net, and a punitive approach to poverty (Esping-Andersen, 2000; Grover & Piggott, 2013). Other scholars have suggested that the characterization of Australia and New Zealand as liberal welfare states downplays some unique characteristics and that it is more accurate to talk about Australia and New Zealand as having developed a “wage earner’s welfare state” (Castles, 1984). The notion of a wage earner’s welfare state emphasizes the central role given to high minimum wages in redistribution, a generous social wage, and a robust system of industrial rights. These aspects were supported by the substantial use of protective tariffs to bolster wage levels in manufacturing, urban service, and a strong concern with the regulation of labor supply through controlled migration (Castles, 1994).",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137535320_1,Neoliberal Frontiers and Economic Insecurity: Is Basic Income a Solution?,https://openalex.org/W2470026333

-0.066931166,-10.610872,Period3,"Introduction This paper examines the nature of &lsquo;free labor&rsquo; (Terranova, 2004) and its compensation in today&rsquo;s cognitive capitalism. (Boutang, 2011) Specifically, it tries to show how free labor involves into not only the generation of immaterial goods such as knowledge, information, culture, communication, relationship, and brand but also the production of various categories of material goods including motor cycles, medicines, musical instruments, and so on. In so doing, this paper explores how free labor of networked populations has been increasingly externalizing capital&rsquo;s management function from production processes and thus reinforcing the &lsquo;becoming rent of capital&rsquo;. (Vercellone, 2008) In addition, it enquires into the exploitation of free labor in conjunction with the notion of the voluntariness of labor and the immaterial compensation (e.g., reputation or peer recognition) that could be considered as major discursive resources for the reproduction of cognitive capitalism. Furthermore, by examining various strategies coping with the gratuitous dynamics of immaterial products facilitated by contemporary digital networking environments, this article tries to seek for a fair way to compensate for the free cognitive and affective labor. First, contents-vectoralists of music and film industries employ the legal device of &lsquo;Digital Rights Management (DRM)&rsquo; as a way to secure their profits. And thus, they are strengthening rent-seeking economy and constraining various forms of the long-standing cultural practices among populations. Second, &lsquo;Micropayment System&rsquo; is often regarded as a market-friendly solution to the gratuitous dynamics of digital labor by contents-vectoralists of journalism and publishing, many platform-vectoralists, and some libertarian consumer groups. Third, the concept of &lsquo;Universal Basic Income&rsquo; could be an effective social policy for the proper compensation for free labor in the sense that it extends the logic of social and common nature of production to the sphere of distribution. Background and Discussion Even though free labor in digital networks may not necessarily be unavoidable (Andrejevic, 2009), it still remains as an enforced labor in the sense that agreements of users on the terms of use set up by platform providers may be interpreted as a form of socially embedded enforcement. Furthermore, products of free labor are mostly put under a platform-vectoralists&rsquo; disposal. Similar to a contract of wage labor, users&rsquo; agreement on the terms of use enables platform providers to take a whole control over products of free labor. Indeed, private appropriation of social and common products of unpaid labor became a key object of exploitation in cognitive capitalism. So, here come two main reasons to think about a material compensation for free labor. First, even though much of free labor is not only performed by immaterial motivations such as a pursuit of technical perfection, an acquirement of reputational capital, and the spread of commonism but also compensated in an immaterial manner, it is far from the socio-economic norm of a fair distribution of wealth that platform-vectoralists appropriate the value created by free labor as a form of rent. Second, it is much more necessary to compensate for free labor in a material manner so as to secure the sustainability of cognitive capitalism itself that strives to retain sources of capital accumulation from the creative and innovative free labor among networked populations. The private appropriation of free labor has long been pursued by contents-vectoralists with an ownership of intellectual property rights and DRM might be deemed to be the most recent technological device for that purpose. DRM is mainly led by contents-vectoralists such as Disney, Warner Brothers, EMI, Microsoft, and Amazon and supported by major manufacturers of electronics including Sony, Samsung, Apple, IBM, Panasonic, and so on. Although contents-vectoralists have been trying to limit networked populations&rsquo; free access to ideas and information by introducing DRM, this privatization of digital commons may result in the blocking of creativity and innovation that are vital to the reproduction of cognitive capitalism. With regard to the notion of &lsquo;Micropayment System&rsquo;, some argue for charging all information, knowledge, and culture that is shared on the Internet free of charge and Micropayment System often considered as a proper way to compensate monetarily those who contributed to value creation in digital networks. In spite of the past failures of start-ups such as BitPass, FirstVirtual, Cybercoin, Millicent, Digicash, Internet Dollar, and Pay2See, some newspapers actively seek for a building of payment system to each news articles so as to relieve the company&rsquo;s financial burden. New York Times and Financial Times are currently running &lsquo;Metered Paywalls&rsquo; model and many more newspaper capitals are expected to join the track. And &lsquo;Google Wallet&rsquo; seems to providing a new momentum for the spread of Micropayment System. Meanwhile, it constitutes another reason for the idea of Micropayment System that many criticize platform-vectoralists such as Google and Facebook for their monopolization of the profits coming from the use of huge user-generated data on the Internet. Several social network services (e.g. Teckler, Pheed, Datacoup) actually run the business model which get back some of their profit to their users as a form of payment for using their personal data. Even some consumer activists refuse the highly common and idealized concept of &lsquo;freedom of information&rsquo; and &lsquo;free information&rsquo; since it enables, to a great extent, platform-vectoralists with a huge networking power to use and capture users&rsquo; value-creating activities free of charge. So, in order to realize information economy in which a new middle-class can emerge, we need, some argue, to renounce the familiar concept of &lsquo;free information&rsquo; and to employ a universal Micropayment System. (Lanier, 2013), However, Micropayment System, on the one hand, must disentangle a very complicate matter of ownership of immaterial goods and, on the other hand, inevitably require the establishment of an highly intensive digital surveillance system. Thus, this market-oriented solution for the compensation could not serve as a viable alternative. Conclusions Basic Income, as a way for a social and common compensation, may be able to deal with failures of rent-seeking economy developing in the sphere of culture and information beyond the realm of natural resources. It may also play a significant role in the realization and spread of social value of a common cultural inheritance. The concept of Basic Income is often justified in two different ways. First, all economic wealth and value is generated by social cooperation. That is, the creation of wealth should be considered not in terms of the product of individuals&rsquo; laboring power but in terms of social bond and cooperation among individuals. Therefore, every individual is deemed to retain the right to acquire wealth from these social and common resources. Second, key elements of production (e.g. tools, technology, and knowledge) belong to a communal cultural tradition and human heritage. So, we are all just cultural inheritors of human community and have to right to receive dividends. These two justifications of Basic Income seem to have a great relevance to today&rsquo;s cognitive capitalism. Its accumulation regime greatly relies upon the production of immaterial goods such as information, knowledge, and culture and its mode of production increasingly focuses on cooperation among networked populations. Furthermore, given the increasing flexibilization of employment relationships and differentiation between internal and external labor markets, universal Basic Income may play a crucial role in relieving the instability of cognitive capitalism.

Most developed nations provide financial assistance to persons with limited abilities. In 1974, an Icelandic government passed an act of law providing a tax credit, payable to taxpayers under certain conditions. The tax allowance was applied first to settle the taxes and public levies owed by the taxpayer, with any amount remaining paid out to the individual. This system can be seen as a first, limited attempt at establishing a partial universal basic income of sorts. This social interaction between stakeholders on how to share the tax revenue between the taxpayers led to a government crisis. The shareholders in this partial universal basic income system, the state and municipalities, the old age community, the trade unions, and the employers all have different financial and political interests and were affected by this reform. The lesson is that a basic income would need strong supporters if implemented, where the role of the government and/or the parliament would be mapped. Its supporters must be able to withstand the pressure from the social partners in the labor market because of the interactivity of the social security system and the pension fund system, which is not a part of the fiscal system in Iceland.

Historians’ attention has largely focussed on the formation of the Child Poverty Action Group and its long campaign to persuade Harold Wilson and James Callaghan’s Labour governments to introduce a universal Child Benefit. The most radical response to the poverty problem, however, came from the Conservative government led by Edward Heath, which published plans to replace the whole system of personal tax allowances with reversible tax credits. This article examines the origins of the Heath government’s Tax Credit Scheme, which promised both to reduce the cost of tax administration and to alleviate the ‘poverty trap’ created by means-tested benefits such as Family Income Supplement. It argues that the development of the Tax Credit Scheme in 1971–2 signalled the abandonment of the selectivity agenda with which the Conservatives had taken office in 1970, and so can be seen as one of Heath’s many ‘U-turns’. As the plans took shape, however, the cost of introducing the reforms on a no-losers basis became a source of growing concern within the government.

In the first part of this paper I argue that liberal neutrality favors BI. Marxist critics of BI are less likely to accept liberal neutrality, but I argue in the second part that the argument for BI in the first part applies with equal force to Marxist objections that BI is unfairly exploitative of workers. Marxists are also less likely to accept current labor market trends, seeing socialism as affording more opportunity for guaranteeing everyone a right to decent work, and suspecting BI of making the unfair inequalities of capitalism a little more palatable while diverting attention from a more equitable socialist alternative. I argue that BI is not incompatible with socialism or Marxism, and should not be opposed to but rather combined with strategies for full employment.

Schutz does not explore possible disincentives to work or misallocations of labor that might diminish over time the total available for distribution, other than to point out that people work for many reasons besides money and that automation can replace the more expensive and undesirable jobs. 4 Objections to a participation income, as attractive as it might seem in principle, are of a more pragmatic character. See below. 5 I am not sure which traditions they speak for, but there are many distinguished thinkers who have endorsed a right to unconditional income, including Bertrand Russell (Citation1935), Paul LaFargue (Citation1986), and Nobel economists James Tobin (Tobin et al. Citation1967; Tobin Citation1998), Herbert Simon (Citation2001), and James Meade (Citation1989). Thus it seems hazardous to maintain that anyone who thinks this way adheres to a conception of the good life that is beyond the pale of liberalism. 7 Philippe Van Parijs, correspondence quoted in Torisky (Citation1993: 296). 6 This is not an argument for the capitalist's contribution. On the contrary, often the contribution of capital involves no contribution of the capitalist. From the standpoint of justice all such assets are collective property. Even when these assets are institutionalized in the form of private property, cooperative property, or state property, we must not lose sight of the requirement of justice to equalize the opportunities associated with control over such assets. 8 See van der Veen and Van Parijs (Citation1986) for an argument for BI as a step toward this ""communist"" principle of justice. 9 I owe this objection and many of the other objections addressed in this section to David Schweickart's comments (Schweickart Citation2000) on my book (Howard Citation2000). In this book I defend a form of worker-managed market socialism, together with a basic income. 10 Barry (Citation1996) makes a pragmatic case for basic income. 11 The jobs people price themselves into at the lower end of the job market will be part-time, temporary, and more lowly paid. On the one hand, some see this as a desirable situation both for employers who seek more flexible labor markets, and for those employees who seek a more flexible work schedule to accommodate family and other priorities. On the other hand, critics see BI as here facilitating the erosion of good jobs—jobs that are well-paying, permanent, and full time, and the entrenchment of two-tiered labor markets. However, BI is compatible with a policy of promoting full employment of the more robust sort, aiming at full-time, regular employment for all who seek it. The worker's right to refuse undesirable forms of employment, which BI strengthens more the higher its level, should lead many employers to offer more ""good"" jobs in order to attract workers. The issues raised here underscore that BI needs to be part of a package of measures that includes labor market policy. 12 Roemer estimates the annual dividend on non-financial, non-farm corporate and non-corporate wealth per adult in the 1980s to be about $1,200, if these assets were to be nationalized and distributed equally (1994: 133 – 143). A real world example of a citizen's dividend is the Alaska Permanent Fund, which grants to every resident of Alaska an unconditional income based on investments from the Alaskan oil revenues. Current information on the Alaska Permanent Fund can be found at the following web site: www.apfc.org/ The dividend in 2002 was $1,540.76 per resident. 13 For a higher estimate, based on Clark's data, see Harvey (Citation2003). 14 For the bottom quintile, the average household income would increase by $9,613, for the second, by $7,250, and for the third, by $4,262 (Clark Citation2003: 150 – 152). For analysis of who would benefit from a more modest, tax neutral BI for the United Kingdom, see Atkinson (Citation1996). 15 This is not to imply that these wages were determined by the needs of workers' families, rather than the bargaining power of the workers. The decline in such bargaining power has forced both members of two-adult households into the labor market. 16 One such critic of the right to work is Standing (Citation2002), cited in Harvey (Citation2003). 17 For these and other important points in support of a right to work, see Harvey (Citation2003).",https://doi.org/10.1080/00346760500364775,"Basic income, liberal neutrality, socialism, and work",https://openalex.org/W2006832733

What is new is the scale of these problems, particularly access to water for the poorest of the poor. This paper discusses the various conceptual responses to the water problématique, including the commodity, public and social approaches. The human rights aspects of the latter are analysed in some detail in light of the recent General Comment on the Right to Water by a United Nations body. The paper argues that countries have international legal obligations, to respect, protect and fulfil this right without discrimination, that carry clear implications for policy and practice. While the report does not argue that this human right requires the complete decommodification of water or that it provides a 'magic bullet' solution, it seeks to show the benefits of a human rights approach and provides some suggestions for implementing the right at the local, national and international levels.

They explore Lockean libertarianism, classical liberalism, and left-libertarianism; and they argue that most strands of libertarianism support some (albeit limited) redistribution, though on varying grounds. They next demonstrate that once one accepts the legitimacy of redistribution in a libertarian world, unconditional cash transfers best reflect core libertarian principles. Firstly, such transfers further individual autonomy by recognising that all individuals—including the poor—are usually better judges of their own needs than the government. Secondly, decoupling redistributive transfers from work requirements acknowledges the inability of the government to exercise the requisite discretion to distinguish the ‘deserving’ from the ‘undeserving’ in a principled way.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23614-4_22,Libertarian Perspectives on Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2976264718

A Radical Proposal for a Free Society and a Sane Economy, Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght table two arguments that focus explicitly on the European Union. Their first argument concerns strategies to introduce basic income at the national level: VP&V argue that there is a tension between national basic income and the European principle of free movement; to cope with the threat of selective immigration, the sustainability of national basic income imposes ‘firm limits on hospitality’. The second argument concerns the introduction of a pan-European basic income: VP&V contend that pan-European basic income is the best answer to social challenges created by European integration. In this paper, I develop three claims. My first claim is that VP&V are unclear about the consequences of ‘firm limits on hospitality’ for the European principle of free movement: this renders their case ambiguous with regard to a core feature of the EU. National basic income seems incompatible with a consistent and legitimate logic of free movement and non-discrimination; to support this claim, I sketch a normative framework with regard to free movement and non-discrimination. My second claim concerns VP&V’s case for pan-European basic income. If it is true that the EU’s principal justice-related problem is that European integration has diminished core capabilities of national welfare states, such as national redistribution and national stabilization, without adequately ensuring their functioning at a higher level, the remedies to that problem are essentially different from a pan-European basic income. My third claim concerns both national basic income and pan-European basic income. The starting point of VP&V’s case for basic income is compelling: we all benefit from a common inheritance, for which none of us did anything. However, more arguments are needed why basic income should be the priority amidst competing claims on the ‘gift’ constituted by past technological, economic and social progress. In fact, the need to add a social dimension to the European project militates against rather than in favour of basic income, be it national or pan-European.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3011847,Basic Income in the European Union: A Conundrum Rather than a Solution,https://openalex.org/W2765891321

Recent calls for a guaranteed annual income (GAI), defined as regular income provided to citizens by the state regardless of work status, raise questions about the impact, relative to the costs, of such a population health intervention. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of Canadian seniors' benefits (Old Age Security/Guaranteed Income Supplement, analogous to a GAI program) on the self-reported health, self-reported mental health and functional health of age-eligible, low-income seniors.We used the 2009-2010 Canadian Community Health Survey to examine unattached adult respondents with an annual income of $20,000 or less, stratified by seniors' benefits/GAI eligibility (55-64 years: ineligible; 65-74 years: eligible). Using regression, we assessed self-reported health, selfreported mental health and functional health as measured by the Health Utilities Index, as outcomes for seniors' benefits/GAI-eligible and -ineligible groups.We found that individuals age-eligible for seniors' benefits/GAI had better health outcomes than recipients of conditional income assistance programs. Eligibility for seniors' benefits/GAI after age 64 was associated with better self-reported health, functional health and self-reported mental health outcomes, and these effects were observed until age 74.Using seniors' benefits as an example, a GAI leads to significantly better mental health and improved health overall.

-10.16203,-6.5712256,Period2,"By the beginning of the 20th century, Australia was commonly acknowledged to be amongst the world leaders in the supply of social provisions to its citizens. However. Australia gradually lost ground in this arena compared with other developed countries. The election of the Whitlam Labor Government in 1972 presented Australia with the first reform oriented government since the end of the Second World War: a considerable number of suggestions were put forward to extend and improve social welfare programs. 

This study investigates those suggestions which dealt with the development of more comprehensive income maintenance programs. It looks, in particular, at the proposal made by the Poverty Inquiry to introduce a Guaranteed Minimum Income - and examines why it (or a similar scheme) was not implemented and what, if any, ideological obstacles to its introduction remain relevant in the last part of this century. But before that can be done, it is necessary to examine the existing system of income maintenance, its structure, the mechanisms which create that structure, and to ascertain what makes the present system of income maintenance attractive to many people.

Attitudes to work, the family and the way social need is viewed affect the public's preparedness to support welfare initiatives; these attitudes are considered preliminary to an examination of a number of generalised income guarantee proposals. The history of income guarantee schemes suggested in Britain, the United States of America and Australia is provided as a backdrop against which the ideological debates which such proposals evoked are assessed. 

The analysis of the ideological obstacles to income guarantees in Australia reveals the impediments embedded in the existing system of income maintenance and shows that these are not contained within the central tenets of Marxism, liberalism or social democracy. They are to be found associated with conservatism and discrimination based on gender, age, race, and locality. 

Before proceeding to estimate the likely response of either the Labor or Liberal Parties to income guarantees, the study establishes that there is no inherent incompatibility between the Australian mode of production and such guarantees. An examination of the Labor and Liberal Parties' social welfare platforms, their philosophical traditions, and spokespersons· pronouncements suggests that it would be possible for either Party to implement a form of income guarantee.",,Income maintenance in Australia: The income guarantee alternative,https://openalex.org/W2187679303
-9.846017,-4.835969,Period3,"The present study examined the historical basis of the Australian disability income support system from 1908 to 2007. Although designed as a safety net for people with a disability, the disability income support system within Australia has been highly targeted. The original eligibility criteria of permanently incapacitated for work, medical criteria and later partially capacitated for work potentially contained ideological inferences that permeated across the time period. This represents an important area for study given the potential consequence for disability income support to marginalise people with a disability.

Social policy and disability policy theorists, including Saunders (2007, Social Policy Research Centre [SPRC]) and Gibilisco (2003) have provided valuable insight into some of the effects of disability policy and poverty. Yet while these theorists argued for some form of income support they did not propose a specific form of income security for further exploration. Few studies have undertaken a comprehensive review of the history of disability income support within the Australian context. This thesis sought to redress these gaps by examining disability income support policy within Australia. The research design consisted of an in-depth critical historical-comparative policy analysis methodology. The use of critical historical-comparative policy analysis allowed the researcher to trace the construction of disability within the Australian disability income support policy across four major historical epochs. A framework was developed specifically to guide analysis of the data. The critical discourse analysis method helped to understand the underlying ideological dimensions that led to the predominance of one particular approach over another. Given this, the research purpose of the study centred on: 

i. Tracing the history of the Australian disability income support system.
ii. Examining the historical patterns and ideological assumptions over time.
iii. Exploring the historical patterns and ideological assumptions underpinning an alternative model (Basic Income) and the extent to which each model promotes the social citizenship of people with a disability.

The research commitment to a social-relational ontology and the quest for social change centred on the idea that   has to be a better way in the provision of disability income support. This theme of searching for an alternative reality in disability income support policy resonated throughout the thesis. This thesis found that the Australian disability income support system is disabling in nature and generates categories of disability on the basis of ableness. From the study, ableness became a condition for citizenship. This study acknowledged that, in reality, income support provision reflects only one aspect of the disabling nature of society which requires redressing. Although there are inherent tensions in any redistributive strategy, the Basic Income model potentially provides an alternative to the Australian disability income support system, given its grounding in social citizenship.

Point of departure is an economy with job scarcity. A fair way to deal with job scarcity is to grant everybody an equal right to work, where these rights can be freely traded. It turns out that such a Labour Rights scheme and a basic income scheme are equivalent. The equivalence is that the price of Labour Rights and the unemployment benefit corresponds to the income tax rate and basic income respectively. The tax rate can thus be considered as what workers have to pay to appropriate scarce job assets. Both schemes allow that some people voluntarily abstain from doing paid work, in return for a financial compensation. Therefore, the advantages in terms of equity and efficiency of a Labour Rights scheme equally apply to the basic income proposal. This analysis provides an argument against cutting unemployment and social assistance benefits during economic downturns and it offers new insights to evaluate the parasitism and exploitation objection raised against basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0770451800010800,"Basic income, unemployment and job scarcity",https://openalex.org/W2038433219

The 1996 US welfare reform welfare for single mother families was no longer an entitlement and there were stiff work requirements enforced by sanctions and time limits. In Western Europe, although there is variation, welfare has become conditional for social assistance recipients  the ""socially excluded."" Social assistance is administered at the municipal level, which contracts with private companies. Caseworkers are supposed to make individualized contracts emphasizing work activities. This paper examines the field-level data in several US programs and finds that there is a symbiotic relationship between governments and contractors; caseworkers, whether public or private, focus on process rather than substantive plans; government does not question the data; contracts are imposed; the most employable are placed; and the most vulnerable are sanctioned or otherwise not allowed on welfare. Research in some European countries is showing similar results  activation programs are difficult to administer and increase the risks for the most vulnerable. Individualized contracts are a myth, given administrative constraints and client dependency. The paper argues that the difficulties of activation are an additional reason for a basic income guarantee.

54.827522,8.703843,Period3,"Abstract Alongside a series of cuts that will reduce welfare spending by £18 billion per year by 2014–15, the UK government announced in November 2010 plans to integrate and simplify means‐tested welfare benefits and in‐work tax credits for working‐age adults into a single programme, to be known as Universal Credit and to be phased in from October 2013. The aims were to make it easier for claimants to claim benefits, to make the gains to work more transparent and to reduce the amount spent on administration and lost in fraud and error. More households will see entitlements rise from the move to Universal Credit considered in isolation than will see entitlements fall; in aggregate, entitlements will rise by nearly £1.1 billion a year. Low‐income families will see their entitlements rise by more than high‐income families, on average, and couples will gain more from the reform, on average, than single‐adult families, especially if there are also children in the family. In general, those facing the weakest incentive to work at all, or the weakest incentive to increase earnings, see their incentives strengthened, including those with very low earnings and hours worked per week and those who at present experience simultaneous withdrawal of multiple means‐tested benefits and tax credits.

34.515915,0.243685,Period3,"The PASHMINA (paradigm shifts modeling and innovative approaches) project grew out of the need to improve our understanding of the paradigm shift in the energy-transport-landuse nexus and, more broadly, in world development. In envisioning the world at 2050, we envisaged future growth in four possible directions: growth without limits, growth within limits, stagnation, and New Welfare. The scenario considered as preferable reflects a transition toward a New Welfare, characterized by a high level of cooperation, heightened concern for the environment and for social welfare, and an increased share of immaterial consumption. This scenario is based on the recognition that the development of new technologies – although relevant – turns out to be insufficient to resolve the issue of resource scarcity alone. Important behavioral changes are also needed. In the New Welfare scenario, GDP as a measure of growth becomes obsolete and needs to be replaced with ways of measuring progress that are more reflective of natural, human, and social capital. The New Welfare scenario also charts a pathway toward a low-carbon future, with an overall reduction in energy consumption, density, and intensity, and a greatly reduced reliance on fossil fuels. A new, smart electric grid facilitates active demand management and decentralized production of power. Natural gas or even small nuclear plants tackle problems associated with the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Among other likely shifts under this scenario is a re-conceptualization of production, from short-lived to longer-lasting goods and from private to open source knowledge products and services; growth in recycling and zero-waste processes; and a shift from profit-driven business to entrepreneurship that seeks to satisfy social needs and build local capital. The world undergoes a transition from unequal growth to prosperity in a multi-polar, globally interdependent world. New global democracy networks and institutions are created, and constitutions extend beyond the protection of human rights to the recognition of “nature rights.” Citizens’ income is tied to the social welfare-oriented duties and participatory governance. This scenario further leaves room to new forms of self-regulation of common resources. Actions necessary for the shift to the New Welfare paradigm include the adoption of new metrics for measuring progress, measures to increase public acceptance of technological and societal change, the creation of new global and local institutions devoted to sustainable management of shared environmental resources, sustainable production and consumption patterns, and a low-carbon energy and transport systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2013.10.019,The world in 2050 and the New Welfare scenario,https://openalex.org/W2091378366

Authoritarian work conditions violate overlap but distinct values, related to democratic government, meaningful work, non-domination, exploitation, and the quality of leisure time. To the degree that democratizing work is supposed to advance these values, a basic income is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for eliminating authoritarian work conditions. It might, in some conditions, reduce some of the worst aspects of our current workplace relationships. But, by the same token, it might exacerbate them, especially if a basic income becomes a substitute for collective self-organization by workers.

9.956828,-10.424547,Period3,"This article contributes to the debate on automation and justice by discussing two under-represented concerns: labour justice and equality. Since automation involves both winners and losers, and given that there is no 'end of work' on the horizon, it is argued that most normative views on the subject – i.e. the 'allocative' view of basic income, and the 'desirability' views of post-work and workist ethics – do not provide many resources with which to address unjustly unequal divisions of labour involved in technological innovation. This article problematises these common responses reframing the problem from the perspective of labour justice. While the allocative view assumes that labour justice follows 'spontaneously' from income redistribution, the desirability views are chiefly interested in either defining or contesting the meanings of work for individuals, overlooking the interdependent nature of work and concerns of equality other than autonomy. Two conceptions of labour justice are thus applied to the problem: Paul Gomberg's contributive justice, and Iris Young's democratic division of labour. Instead of deciding between them, the normative core of 'contributive parity' is suggested as a critical standard for assessing unequal labour structures, and for envisaging a future in which technology can be an ally in making social cooperation fair.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17496535.2018.1512141,"Automation, Labour Justice, and Equality",https://openalex.org/W2889167909

Most strongly manifest in earnings-related social insurance, the principle of reciprocity has been increasingly questioned on grounds of equity, adequacy and fiscal viability, in the wake of socio-economic changes (e.g. post-industralisation, globalisation) and political developments (e.g. Europeanisation). Universalist programmes seem extraordinarily expensive under tight public budgets, and could be criticised as inequitable at a time when middle classes increasingly rely on individual and occupational forms of income security. The principle of need appears to have become more prominent within modern European social security systems keen on targeting resources. Is there empirical evidence which would reflect these alleged trends? Concentrating on three principles inherent in social security transfers (need, universalism and reciprocity) the major concerns of this article are conceptual and empirical. First, it addresses the problem of operationalising social security principles and delineating indicators of change over time. Second, it applies two of these indicators in order to identify and compare the extent to which the three principles have gained or lost prominence since the early 1980s, with empirical evidence taken from the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia. The article argues first that, applying either indicator, there is no cross-national trend towards squeezing reciprocity-based social insurance, but that a convergence between erstwhile strong (Bismarckian) and weak (Beveridgean) principled programmes can be identified. Second, a clear trend towards needs-based social security can be identified within the ‘legal’ but not within the ‘volume’ perspective, at least in some programmes and some claimant groups. This is due to both policy changes and favourable labour market conditions. Third, two countries indicate very diverse trends. British social security is distinctive in terms of the erosion of Beveridgean reciprocity, as well as the growing strength of the needs principle. In the Netherlands, there have been considerable shifts in principles underlying certain programmes, but no general trend in either direction can be observed.

This article theorizes and explores empirically the relationship between different strands of left ideology and support for UBI across European countries. We delineate three types of concerns about capitalism: “Labourist Left” worry about exploitation ; “Libertarian Left” about repression and “Social Investment Left” about inefficiencies . Contrary to expectations we derive from political theory and welfare state literature, our results based on data from the European Social Survey suggest that having high concerns about exploitation is positively correlated with support for UBI, whereas repression concerns are negatively correlated with support. In line with our hypothesis about social investment ideology, left-leaning individuals with efficiency concerns are more likely to support UBI. Our findings call for more detailed surveys as well as further research on the different ideologies within the Left and how these relate to variation in support for UBI, which crucially shapes the potential political coalition behind the introduction of UBI.",https://doi.org/10.1017/ics.2020.25,The Left and universal basic income: the role of ideology in individual support,https://openalex.org/W3094163981

However, when controlling for confounding variables, union membership is not statistically significant, suggesting that it is not membership per se, but the characteristics of unionised workers that make them less supportive. In many countries, a coalition between centrist and left-leaning individuals therefore seems most promising, but its political feasibility depends on whether enough union members are favourable to a BIG and on the level of opposition from high income and/or conservative parts of the electorate.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2018-0021,The Politics of the Basic Income Guarantee: Analysing Individual Support in Europe,https://openalex.org/W2953285749

This article examines two aspects of the design of Universal Credit: the aim to make Universal Credit as much ‘like work’ as possible, and the architecture of the means test.

To answer this question, we explore two programs using a gendered framework: Brazil's Bolsa Familia,which is a conditional cash transfer, and Manitoba's Mincome experiment, which was an unconditional cash transfer in Canada.

44.09817,5.821088,Period3,"In 1895 an English farmer diverted the course of a stream that was flowing through his land, thereby cutting off the supply to the water reservoir of the neighboring community. The courts established that it had been his purpose to injure the plaintiffs by carrying off the water and to compel them to buy him off. Regardless of what the law says, most people will feel that the farmer's intentions were morally unjust; he was trying to abuse his property rights in order to take advantage of others. Yet, as Gijs van Donselaar explains, the major traditions in the theory of economic justice, both from the libertarian right and from the egalitarian left, have failed to appreciate the moral objection to exploitative behavior that this case displays. Those traditions entertain radically opposed views on how private property should be distributed, but they do not consider the legitimacy of constraints on the exercise of property rights-however they are distributed. The second part of the book demonstrates how this failure clears the way for a recent egalitarian argument, gaining in popularity, for a so-called unconditional basic income. If all have an initial right to an equal share of the resources of the world, then it soon seems to follow that all have a right to an equal share of the value of the resources of the world, which could be cashed in as a labor-free income. That inference is only valid if moral behavior similar to that of the farmer is tolerated. Van Donselaar argues that, ultimately, a confusion about the nature and value of freedom of choice is responsible for the odd conception of private rights in resources that would justify exploitation.

The Failed Welfare Revolution shows us that things might have turned out differently. During the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers in three presidential administrations tried to replace the nation's existing welfare system with a revolutionary program to guarantee Americans basic economic security. Surprisingly from today's vantage point, guaranteed income plans received broad bipartisan support in the 1960s. One proposal, President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan, nearly passed into law in the 1970s, and President Carter advanced a similar bill a few years later. The failure of these proposals marked the federal government's last direct effort to alleviate poverty among the least advantaged and, ironically, sowed the seeds of conservative welfare reform strategies under President Reagan and beyond. This episode has largely vanished from America's collective memory. Here, Brian Steensland tells the whole story for the first time--from why such an unlikely policy idea first developed to the factors that sealed its fate. His account, based on extensive original research in presidential archives, draws on mainstream social science perspectives that emphasize the influence of powerful stakeholder groups and policymaking institutions.

56.365986,7.626646,Period3,"Utilizing recently opened politically sensitive materials at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, this article shows how welfare reform became increasingly important to the Nixon administration's political ambitions for a new conservative majority, consisting of southern white conservatives and northern working‐ and middle‐class white voters. Welfare reform rose to the top of the president's domestic policy agenda for a number of reasons, but the president selected the Family Assistance Plan (FAP) over more conservative alternatives in keeping with his political aims: the FAP would redistribute federal welfare to the white working poor in northern metropolitan areas, while simultaneously increasing federal welfare spending in southern states. As the 1970 midterm elections approached, however, the predominant political focus for the FAP became the effort to appeal to blue‐collar, northern white‐ethnic voters. In the aftermath of the disappointing results from those elections, President Nixon and his political team became convinced that a New Deal–style redistributive strategy was ineffective in appealing to conservative voters in the “silent majority,” especially southern conservatives who were opposed to any expansion of federal welfare, even when they would benefit directly. Instead, Nixon began to emphasize the FAP's value as a platform for launching strong rhetorical attacks on welfare. While the president subsequently pulled back from pushing for FAP's legislative enactment, offering an important explanation for the measure's failure, his antiwelfare rhetoric was politically successful, providing subsequent national conservative leaders with a political formula for utilizing antiwelfare rhetoric to build support among white working‐ and middle‐class voters.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2012.03989.x,Nixon's New Deal: Welfare Reform for the Silent Majority,https://openalex.org/W1934237607
21.055948,-2.0965457,Period3,"Is a basic income both affordable and desirable? The Covid-19 crisis promises to be as big a shock to the UK economy as the 2007-08 financial crisis. The Office for Budget Responsibility recently published a scenario of the likely economic impact of the coronavirus shock to the economy. Making a number of assumptions, it suggested that real national income would fall by about a third in the second quarter of 2020. Public sector net borrowing would rise to about 14 per cent of national income, and this would be the highest annual deficit since the second world war.1 One idea for relieving the economic effects of the crisis is to implement a universal basic income. A basic income promises: ‘regular, non-means-tested cash transfers to all residents of a political territory on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement’.2 A universal basic income has five key parts, namely, that it: is regular; is paid in cash; is provided to the individual; is universal with no means test; and is unconditional with no requirement to work or seek work.3 Long-standing supporters of a basic income, such as Guy Standing, call for this policy to help people cope with the economic fallout of the global pandemic.4 This piece considers whether Covid-19 affects two key objections to a universal basic income among the left: adequacy and opportunity cost. “A full universal basic income has yet to be implemented in the world. Much existing evidence draws from pilots of partial basic income schemes in places such as Finland, as well as policy simulations” A second objection is that there are alternative policies that are better for relieving poverty. Indeed, critics claim that a universal basic income distracts time and resources from pursuing these other policies. Piachaud summarises this view: “What is perhaps most frustrating for those who see little attraction in pursuing a basic income is that, while it is part of a spectrum of social protection and social security measures, giving it pre-eminence diverts from the task of promoting more feasible and sensible reforms. There is a desperate need for more investment in human capital for the least advantaged and for more equal opportunities for all.”9 A range of arguments might be advanced both for and against the various claims that Piachaud makes in the above quotation (for example, the attention paid to investment in human capital for the least advantaged over a universal basic income). This piece does not delve into those arguments here as the focus is on the impact that Covid-19 has on a universal basic income. But the above quotation helps place the arguments about a universal basic income and Covid-19 within a broader context and set of debates. The global pandemic has already prompted some sceptics to rethink their views on a universal basic income.10 Covid-19 presents the need for rapid and immediate relief. It may be very complex to devise rapid and targeted help, and so universal income payments have the virtue of simplicity. This has been taken on board in the government response. For example, the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme provides a taxable grant to employers for furloughed employees worth 80 per cent of the employee's wage cost (up to £2,500 a month).11 A similar package of support is also provided to the self-employed. In the US, President Donald Trump signed an act promising $2 trillion of federal government help to households and businesses. Among the measures enacted are a set of economic impact payments that amount to $1,200 per person for one year and up to $500 for each child under 16 years of age.12 “Research suggests that the low-paid are among those hit worst by the coronavirus lockdown” Research suggests that the low-paid are among those hit worst by the coronavirus lockdown. One-third of employees in the bottom tenth of the earnings distribution work in sectors that are shut down, compared with 5 per cent of those in top tenth of the earnings distribution. Furthermore, women are more badly affected than men, with 17 per cent of female employees working in sectors that are shut down compared to 13 per cent of male employees.13 Many households are facing falls in income, but poorer households are less able to cope with drops in income because a larger part of their household budget is spent on essential items than richer households. On average, the poorest fifth of households spend around 55 per cent of their budgets on essential items, while the richest fifth spent around 39 per cent. This pattern is reversed for items that have been affected by social distancing measures such as travel, leisure or eating out.14 Clearly, poorer households are in greater need of help than richer ones in coping with Covid-19. This suggests that targeted income support may be the priority rather than universal income payments. “Government spending here arose from a very specific set of conditions that, one hopes, are unlikely to be repeated for some time” One might counter, though, that it is very difficult to draw general lessons from the exceptional nature of Covid-19. Government spending here arose from a very specific set of conditions that, one hopes, are unlikely to be repeated for some time. The 2007-08 financial crisis ushered in a decade of austerity. A Conservative government charged with dealing with the aftermath of Covid-19 might make similar fiscal choices, and this is without taking account on the pressures on public finances from Brexit. This alternative view offers a gloomier reading about the affordability of a universal basic income. While it is true that the bounds of government spending may be greater than often is presented in policy debates, it is unclear whether the Covid-19 crisis will seriously weaken the view that an adequate universal basic income is unaffordable. Again, it is likely that the best prospect is for a time limited scheme of emergency payments rather than a permanent income stream. The second objection to a universal basic income asks whether there are better alternatives for relieving poverty. One such alternative is universal basic services. The pandemic has made clear which services are deemed to be essential in a modern economy. The UK government published a list of key workers who are allowed to travel to their normal place of work during the crisis. These included those working in health services; transport; food supply; the police; and those working in utilities such as electricity, gas or water.16 These key worker sectors overlap considerably with calls for a welfare state built around universal basic services.17 There are seven core services in the model of universal basic services, namely: health care; education; shelter; food; transport; legal and democracy; and information. The aim is for these services to be publicly funded and be free at the point of delivery. Some services are familiar and are already provided in the welfare state such as the National Health Service. Other services are more novel. For example, an information service would provide free basic phone and internet access to all citizens. This proposal overlaps with the promise made in Labour's 2019 general election manifesto to provide free broadband for all,18 a pledge which was derided at the time in much of the media and public discussions. (Arguably, one failing of the manifesto was that it did not embed the broadband idea in a supporting policy approach such as universal basic services). “some aspects of a universal basic services approach are probably a greater priority at the moment than a universal basic income. But there is also a case for emergency income payments to help people and households cope with the immediate economic shocks from Covid-19” Schools were closed prior to the official lockdown. The education of schoolchildren depends largely upon them being able to access online lessons or homework from school. Evidence from Lloyds Bank Consumer Digital Index reports that in 2018, 700,000 11 to 18 year olds (12 per cent) have no internet access at home through a computer or tablet.20 Similarly, in the official lockdown period, employees who could work from home were instructed to do so. But the capacity to work also depends on access to the internet. And for the retired who are staying at home, the internet is a way for them to maintain social contacts. For these reasons, some aspects of a universal basic services approach are probably a greater priority at the moment than a universal basic income. But there is also a case for emergency income payments to help people and households cope with the immediate economic shocks from Covid-19. The questions of the best mix of universal basic services and emergency income payments to react to the crisis remains open. Covid-19 has caused a major shock to the economy. As politicians and policymakers grapple with its challenges, one initial response has been to refuel calls for a universal basic income. This piece suggests that, despite the flurry of interest, Covid-19 is unlikely to change the core arguments over a universal basic income. At best, the coronavirus makes a case for temporary emergency income payments. Turning these temporary payments into permanent ones requires engaging with the more usual arguments over a basic income heard in more usual times. Questions remain about the best mix of universal basic services and emergency income payments for reacting to the crisis, with one priority now being to address a digital divide.

This article uses evidence from the fifth sweep of the National Child Development Study to analyse the use of childcare by a cohort of employed women who were aged 33 in 1991. There is a heavy reliance on informal care by women in partnerships and also by lone mothers. Formal care is most heavily used by women whose youngest child is under five, especially if the woman works full-time. Reported costs of childcare represent nearly a quarter of net weekly earnings for mothers with a child under five. Formal childcare is shown to play an important role in facilitating women's full-time employment. Full-time employment is the route by which women achieve financial independence from their partner. It also increases the likelihood of contributing to an occupational pension which, in turn, has implications for financial independence in later life. However, the majority of women in this cohort do not take the full-time route. For these women, low earnings potential and part-time working make paid childcare uneconomic and reinforces both their role as minor financial contributors within the family and their lack of pension provision in later life.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400000325,Combining Employment with Childcare: An Escape From Dependence?,https://openalex.org/W2133448432

-55.50826,1.5740281,Period3,"Abstract Stuart White argues that egalitarians need a diverse toolkit of policy proposals in order to move closer to a just economic system. In particular he argues that a policy of Basic Capital grants should be included in this toolkit along with a variety of other more familiar instruments such as unconditional Basic Income, welfare state services and income supports, and support for worker cooperatives. The various policies in the egalitarian toolkit, however, have implications for issues other than contributing to a more just economic system. In particular, they have implications for the long term stability, transformation, or even transcendence, of capitalism as an economic system. In this article I will argue that unconditional Basic Income has a greater potential to erode capitalism than does Basic Capital. While both of these policies in the egalitarian toolkit may make the economic system statically more just, over time Basic Capital grants are likely to strengthen capitalism as the core structure of the economic system, whereas unconditional Basic Income has the potential to erode the dominance of capitalism.

At the scale of agricultural enterprises, a labor perspective highlights the jobs generated, and the rewards received, by people who work in and around large farms. This approach guides my critical reading of the report prepared by a World Bank team that argues for large-scale land acquisition as a way to reduce poverty. Using data from within the report itself, I show why poverty reduction is a very unlikely result. I develop the argument further by drawing on research in colonial and contemporary Indonesia, where large-scale plantations and associated smallholder contract schemes have a long history. A labor perspective is also relevant at the national and transnational scale, where it highlights the predicament of people whose labor is not needed by the global capitalist system. In much of the global South, the anticipated transition from the farm to factory has not taken place and education offers no solution, as vast numbers of educated people are unemployed. Unless vast numbers of jobs are created, or a global basic income grant is devised to redistribute the wealth generated in highly productive but labor-displacing ventures, any program that robs rural people of their foothold on the land must be firmly rejected.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2011.559009,Centering labor in the land grab debate,https://openalex.org/W1965753079

Some advocates are calling for introducing a universal basic income (UBI), either as a floor to provide a basic level of subsistence, as a complement to existing welfare state policies, or in some cases as a replacement for the welfare state. Much of the current interest in UBI stems from a belief that technology is rapidly eliminating jobs faster than new ones can be created, and future job growth will be much lower.

One influential answer is what Frank Lovett calls a 'procedural' account: roughly, power is arbitrary when it is unconstrained by effective, common-knowledge rules. Despite their simplicity and initial appeal, in this paper I argue that we should reject such procedural accounts. After giving the best case for procedural arbitrariness and defending it against an intuitive objection, I proceed by examining a set of problem cases, examples of what Erving Goffman called 'total institutions' – highly rule-bound, tightly controlled environments. Although it is possible for these institutions to be non-arbitrary in the procedural sense, I argue that we should nevertheless see them as prime examples of domination. Such environments produce a relevantly similar bundle of psychological effects – anxiety, adaptation, and so on – to other paradigm cases of domination.

The universal basic income has been particularly hotly debated in recent decades. Regardless of the position, the common tone of the debates is the imperative “we must experiment.” Such a close interest in the universal basic income derives from the fact that it threatens to change the “generic” for humans situation of finiteness of resources and the need to work. Thus, it is able to change the experience of what it means to be human. Since the universal basic income allows to separate labor from income, it is likely that its introduction will return value to the currently stigmatized or devalued types of labor, such as child care, elderly care or domestic work. It creates opportunities for experience redistribution in gender perspective: care and leaving (career break), affective connection, and sensitivity could become the business of both parents, not just mothers. Another experience redistribution is possible in age perspective. Along with automation of labor, population ageing is a universal process that will sooner or later affect all the countries. Alarmist narratives that present this process as a threat and a problem now prevail. They are largely based on outdated ideas about old age and what it means to be old. However, in fact, ageing is the maturation of the population as a whole. With a proper re-evaluation of the meaning and significance of old age, the introduction of the universal basic income could create material conditions for the transfer of experience from the elderly to the younger – for the first time since traditional societies.",https://doi.org/10.30727/0235-1188-2020-63-3-131-141,Universal Basic Income as a Way of Redistribution of Experience between Individuals and Groups,https://openalex.org/W3123579861

An emancipatory social science responding to these propositions faces four broad tasks: specifying the moral principles for judging social institutions; using these moral principles as the standards for diagnosis and critique of existing institutions; developing an account of viable alternatives in response to the critique; and proposing a theory of transformation for realizing those alternatives. The idea of “real utopias” is one way of thinking about alternatives and transformation.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122412468882,Transforming Capitalism through Real Utopias,https://openalex.org/W2111565199

9.21804,-11.150471,Period3,"Abstract Differences in Member States' economic development and national social protection systems can translate into significant differences in the substantive social rights of EU migrant citizens. The substantive rights of economically inactive EU migrant citizens are dependent on the ‘export’ of social rights from their country of origin to the Member State of destination, in particular during the initial phase of their residence in a new Member State as a jobseeker or a pensioner. This paper demonstrates that EU citizens' social rights are substantively stratified, not only by economic status, but also according to the Member State of origin and destination. Stratified social rights, it is argued, generate unequal opportunities to free movement and eo ipso challenge the very concept of EU citizenship. The paper concludes with a proposal for a European Minimum Income Scheme to at least partially overcome the shortcomings of existing EU citizenship.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.12555,Stratified Social Rights Limiting EU Citizenship,https://openalex.org/W2605929328

More than thirty percent of South Africa's population receive such payments, even as pundits elsewhere proclaim the neoliberal death of the welfare state. These programs' successes at reducing poverty under conditions of mass unemployment, Ferguson argues, provide an opportunity for rethinking contemporary capitalism and for developing new forms of political mobilization. Interested in an emerging politics of   Ferguson shows how new demands for direct income payments (including so-called basic income) require us to reexamine the relation between production and distribution, and to ask new questions about markets, livelihoods, labor, and the future of progressive politics.",https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.192594,Give a man a fish: reflections on the new politics of distribution,https://openalex.org/W828557202

In this chapter, we do two things. First, we describe the former Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme as a basic-income-like programme. Using survey data from 2002–2003 to 2014–2015, we examine the impact of the abolition of the CDEP as a proxy for a future basic income scheme on cultural participation. We find that the existence of CDEP was associated with a modest increase in cultural participation, especially in attendance of sporting carnivals. Second, we argue for the implementation of a true basic income scheme in remote Australia as a first priority for a staged programme nationally.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14378-7_5,Basic Income and Cultural Participation for Remote-Living Indigenous Australians,https://openalex.org/W2946275731
29.99969,0.7713605,Period3,"Are there ways that contemporary capitalism can be rendered a dramatically more egalitarian economic system without destroying its productivity and capacity for growth? This book explores two proposals, unconditional basic income and stakeholder grants, that attempt just that. In a system of basic income, as elaborated by Philippe van Parijs, all citizens are given a monthly stipend sufficient to provide them with a no-frills but adequate standard of living. This monthly income is universal rather than means-tested, and it is unconditional--receiving the basic income does not depend upon performing any labor services or satisfying other conditions. It affirms the idea that as a matter of basic rights, no one should live in poverty in an affluent society. In a system of stakeholder grants, as discussed by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, all citizens upon reaching the age of early adulthood receive a substantial one-time lump-sum grant sufficiently large so that all young adults would be significant wealth holders. Ackerman and Alstott propose that this grant be in the vicinity of $80,000 and be financed by an annual wealth tax of roughly 2 percent. A system of stakeholder grants, they argue, expresses a fundamental responsibility: every American has an obligation to contribute to a fair starting point for all. This is volume 5 of the Real Utopias Project, which embraces a tension between dreams and practice. It is founded on the belief that what is pragmatically possibly is not fixed independently of our imaginations, but is itself shaped by our vision. The fulfilment of such a belief involves   utopias: utopian ideals that are grounded in the real potentials for redesigning social institutions. In its attempt at sustaining the deepening serious discussion of radical alternatives to existing social practices, the Real Utopias Project examines various basic institutions and focuses on specific proposals for their fundamental redesign",,Redesigning Distribution: basic income and stakeholder grants as alternative cornerstones for a more egalitarian capitalism,https://openalex.org/W2113220324
-14.569403,-6.166158,Period3,"A prominent feature of the ongoing politics of welfare state restructuring is the development of workfare policies, defined as the attachment of a work condition to entitlement to basic income support. Workfare rejects unconditional rights of social citizenship, which formed the basis of social democratic political reforms and advocacy throughout the twentieth century. Nevertheless, workfare has received notable theoretical justification from egalitarian political theorists. This paper addresses four egalitarian arguments for workfare: the arguments from recipient self-respect, rational paternalism, fair reciprocity, and equal opportunity for active citizenship. It attempts to demonstrate the tensions between each and egalitarian justification, and it is argued that none of the arguments successfully ground workfare policies in an egalitarian framework.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1743453x0700300205,Is Workfare Egalitarian?,https://openalex.org/W4234880639

13.38715,-6.0001864,Period3,"The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) has moved rapidly up the British political agenda in recent years, with support from the Green Party, the Royal Society of Arts, and left-wing writers such as Paul Mason. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has set up a working group to examine its implications, and four Scottish councils are hoping to launch pilot schemes. Contemporary British interest in UBI forms part of a lively global debate about automation, inequality and precarious labour, but it also draws on a long history of proposals for tax-benefit reform within UK social policy. This article identifies five waves of enthusiasm for basic income in Britain over the past century and highlights patterns of continuity and change. It shows that interest in the proposal has been greatest at times of pessimism about the future of the labour market, though concerns about the ethics and affordability of unconditional payments have always been difficult to shake. Advocates of UBI have also struggled to reconcile the technocratic approach of its Conservative and Liberal supporters with the transformative ambitions of the radical left. It remains to be seen whether the recent growth of left-wing support for UBI will improve its prospects of implementation.",https://doi.org/10.17863/cam.20225,"Universal Basic Income in British Politics, 1918-2018: From a 'Vagabond's Wage' to a Global Debate",https://openalex.org/W2779152765
