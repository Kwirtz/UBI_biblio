It is therefore appropriate to begin identifying policy options to address this potential problem. This article offers an economic and social framework for addressing this problem, and then provides an inventory of possible policy options organized into the following six categories:(a) slowing innovation and change; (b) sharing work; (c) making new work; (d) redistribution; (e) education; and (f) fostering a new social contract.",https://doi.org/10.55613/jeet.v24i1.11,"Technology, Unemployment &amp; Policy Options",https://openalex.org/W4294352169

30.71252,44.285576,2,"In November 2007, the Universal Declaration of Emergent Human Rights was approved at the Universal Forum of Cultures in Monterrey, Mexico. Article 1.3 reads: The right to a basic income or universal citizen’s income that guarantees to every human being, independently of age, gender, sexual orientation, civil or employment status, the right to live in material conditions of dignity. To this end, a regular cash payment, financed by tax reforms and covered by the state budget, and sufficient to cover his or her basic needs, is recognized as a right of citizenship of every member-resident of he society, whatever his or her other sources of income may be. The importance of article 1.3 of the Monterrey Declaration lies, first of all, in the fact that, rather than speaking of the right to subsistence, or of having certain minimal vital needs covered in case of the onset of poverty or some catastrophe, it specifically upholds the “right to a basic income or universal citizen’s income” as a guarantee to every single individual of the “right to live in material conditions of dignity.” This is tantamount to pledging that no individual will be excluded from the possibility of engaging in social life and exercising his or her rights and duties as a citizen because of acute poverty.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137265227_6,East Timor and Catalonia: Basic Income — Proposals for North and South,https://openalex.org/W2501628138

As UBI implies a much larger EU budget and a redistribution of collected budget revenues, the chance of introducing UBI depends on the required redistribution – the larger the redistribution, the lower the chance. The chance is indirectly assessed by an exercise in which 50 percent of actual tax revenues generated by indirect taxes of member states is collected at the center and distributed equally to all citizens.

It begins by rejecting the attempt to ground the work requirement on a civic obligation to work. The article then explores the principle of reciprocity, and argues that the practice of reciprocity depends on the particular conception of distributive justice adopted. An examination of different interpretations of egalitarian justice and their corresponding patterns of reciprocity demonstrates that unconditional welfare benefits are compatible with, and sometimes even warranted by, the principle of reciprocity.

Likewise, they focus on political questions around welfare state reforms, redistribution, taxation and funding sources, democratic citizenship, and the prospects for cross-party policy coalitions.

30.295858,16.753454,2,"This paper examines the role of basic income in constructing a dynamic, diverse and democratic social economy. ‘Basic income’ or BI is shorthand for a regular, sufficient and unconditional income, administered by the state and issued to every member of society. BI replaces social welfare payments, child benefit and the state pension as we currently know them. It also extends to all those who currently receive no income from the state. Ideally, a BI would be sufficient for each person to have a frugal but decent lifestyle without supplementary income from paid work.
Basic income is a measure that could be implemented during the current crisis in Ireland. It is a step that is possible within the tax and money regime that prevails at the moment, even in the EU‐ECB‐IMF troika programme. By itself, it will not achieve all that we need, but it has a crucial role to play in the transition to an economy and society based on the well being of all and the sharing of resources for the prosperity of all.
The paper begins by calling for ecological and economic literacy, so that the concept of basic income can be understood in a wider framework of knowledge about:
• managing the resources of the world (the commons) for the benefit of all members of society
• basic securities as a pre‐requisite for sustainability and resilience
• work in its broadest sense, as any engagement with the world – paid or unpaid ‐‐ designed to change something or to add value to society or economy
• the wealth inherent in sufficiency.
The paper then examines the immediate benefits of basic income and the longer‐term possibilities for all kinds of work and workers. It also examines how basic income can support pioneers and seed projects that are already working towards a transformed economic and social regime characterised by greater equality, economic resilience and social solidarity.
The paper treats basic income as an essential and do‐able step in such a transformation. As a stand‐alone measure it would have beneficial effects. But it would have maximum effects if accompanied by democratic reform in tax and money systems.",,Cultivating resilient and ethical prosperity with basic income,https://openalex.org/W339274971

-27.028593,-29.863451,4,"Using panel data for the Netherlands, Germany and the UK for seven years in the late 1980s and early 1990s the paper examines the comparative evidence on longitudinal income and persistent poverty for the three countries. Elaborating on the existing methodological literature of income dynamics, a panel regression model has been estimated to arrive at population wide estimates of the population in persitent and transitory poverty in a comparative perspective. What the model actually pursues is to disentangle income over time in a permanent and transitory part. The idea behind the approach is that what really matters for people’s welfare in the long run is their permanentincome. The basic assumption is that people have a kind of latent long-term income-toneeds level from which occasional departures are possible due to temporary income shortfalls or income surpluses associated with the occurrence of events such as(un)employment, disability or illness, overtime work or working time reductions. According to this framework, poverty can be seen as a state in which permanent income falls below a predefined threshold being the long-term poverty line. The approach can therefore be helpful in estimating the size of the population in persistent poverty. When appropriate variables are added to the empirical model, it is possible to monitor the effect of socio-economic events on the permanent income-to-needs level. Following Esping-Andersen’s seminal work on welfare-state regimes, one might perceive the UK as a liberal welfare state although in a less prototypical sense as it exists in the US. Germany should clearly be considered to belong to the corporatist prototype and the Netherlands to the social-democratic type. Then, presumably, the UK has the lowest permanent income-to-needs level, the highest persistent poverty incidence and the highest income mobility. The findings confirm the presumption that permanent income is lower in a liberal welfare state as the UK although not very much lower than in the other countries. Hence, the transitory part of income is slightly larger in this liberal type of welfare state. The results also show that permanent income is more unequally distributed in the UK than in the Netherlands and Germany and that income inequalities have a less permanent character in the Netherlands. Besides, transitory shocks in income have a less permanent effect in the Netherlands than in the two other countries. The inclusion of household composition or labour market variables does not alter the main results. Viewing the effect of labour market status variables, like living in a household with a not working head, it is shown that members of these households are more likely persistent poor, particularly when the head is female. The effects of household structure on persistent poverty appear quite large. Especially, lone-parents households seem prone to persistent poverty in all three welfare regimes but single elderly particularly in the UK.",,"Persistent poverty in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK",https://openalex.org/W3140778969
42.945824,21.739258,2,"Annotation. Introduction. The article considers the concept of unconditional basic income in the study of social policy as a state instrument of universal social justice. Considerable attention paid to the prospects for the introduction of unconditional basic income and the implementation of its basic principles into Ukrainian legislation. Various approaches of legal regulations and etymology of social policy in the context of the state security system are considered. Significant emphasis placed on the study of the theoretical challenge of unconditional basic income, namely the study of the functioning of such a mechanism in modern communicative realities. This research is a product of analytics and was created without taking into account the author’s political ideas. Given the recommended amount of research, the issues of unconditional basic income was considered not to be completed. Purpose. One of the main tasks of the article is to study the mechanism of functioning of unconditional basic income and the possibility of its application in practice. It is also worth giving your own view of the social policy problems. The tasks of the article are to analyze the modern social security system and to suggest options for its improvement. Results. The theory of unconditional basic income currently has no practical application. Despite a significant number of theoretical experiments, no country in the world uses the instrument of unconditional basic income at the legislative level. Therefore, it is too early to talk about the implementation of this theory of social policy in practice in Ukraine. Conclusions. Theory of unconditional basic income has a strong intellectual tradition, but the practical application of this instrument of social policy not implemented. Our studies show that such a system promotes the development of human capital and increases the geographical mobility of people. Unconditional basic income creates material support that promotes human development in other spheres of life. However, it was noted that conducting such a social policy requires significant expenditures from the state budget. This creates material barriers for some countries to use unconditional basic income as a tool of social policy.

Simultaneously, cash-based welfare policies have frayed, support for public assistance has fallen on the political right, and prejudice against recipients of welfare has remained high. Yet, in recent years Universal Basic Income (UBI) has gained traction, a policy proposing to give all citizens cash sufficient to meet basic needs with no strings attached. We hypothesized that UBI can mitigate the partisanship and prejudice that define the existing welfare paradigm in the US but that this potential depends critically on the narratives attached to it. Indeed, across three online experiments with US adults (total N = 1888), we found that communicating the novel policy features of UBI alone were not sufficient to achieve bipartisan support for UBI or overcome negative stereotyping of its recipients. However, when UBI was described as advancing the more conservative value of financial freedom, conservatives perceived the policy to be more aligned with their values and were less opposed to the policy (meta-analytic effect on policy support: d = 0.36 [95% CI: 0.27 to 0.46]). Extending the literatures on moral reframing and cultural match, we further find that this values-aligned policy narrative mitigated prejudice among conservatives, reducing negative welfare-related stereotyping of policy recipients (meta-analytic effect d = −0.27 [95% CI: −0.38 to −0.16]), while increasing affiliation with them. Together, these findings point to moral reframing as a promising means by which institutional narratives can be used to bridge partisan divides and reduce prejudice.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/bk5g8,Mitigating Welfare-Related Prejudice and Partisanship among US Conservatives with Moral Reframing of a Universal Basic Income Policy,https://openalex.org/W4205141707

Drawing on theories of labor decommodification, market socialism, and social reproduction, as well as more public-facing debates over policy, the purpose of this analysis is to better clarify the stakes a burgeoning left politics might have in pursuing the demand for UBI. Following key justifications put forward by chief proponents of the Wages for Housework movement for pursuing seemingly impractical, impossible, and politically ambiguous demands, I argue that UBI is best treated as a political perspective with both reactionary and revolutionary undercurrents.

Using microsimulation analysis in a comparative two-country setting, we show that the potential poverty-reducing impact of BI strongly depends on exactly how and where it is implemented. Implementing a BI requires far more choices than advocates seem to realise. The level at which a BI is set matters, but its exact specification matters even more. The impact of a BI, be it a low or a high one, also strongly depends on the characteristics of the system that it is (partially) replacing or complementing, as well as the socio-economic context in which it is introduced. Some versions of BI could potentially help to reduce poverty but always at a significant cost and with substantial sections of the population incurring significant losses, which matters for political feasibility. A partial BI complementing existing provisions appears to make more potential sense than a full BI replacing them.

This recognition has been shared by economists, philosophers, and advocates of international human rights, but each have proceeded separately to develop conceptual frameworks and policy mechanisms to achieve the same or similar goals. In the latter part of the 1970s, development economists adopted a ‘basic needs’ (BN) approach to development, largely as a response to the failure of economic growth to alleviate poverty in many developing countries. The objectives of the economists’ basic needs approach were similar to the conclusion of John Rawis’s philosophical system that everyone should have access to ‘basic social goods’.1 Simultaneously, in a parallel and complementary development, international human rights access to goods were recognised first in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)2 and subsequently as part of the Declaration on the Right to Development (1986).3",https://doi.org/10.2307/762098,"Basic Needs Strategies, Human Rights, and the Right to Development",https://openalex.org/W3193885747

Accordingly, this study aims to provide some evidence on relative income hypothesis by investigating the relevance of Duesenberry’s demonstration and ratchet effects in Ethiopia using quarterly data from 1999/2000Q1 to 2018/19Q4. We estimate two specifications of the relative income hypothesis using the traditional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and the dynamic ARDL simulations approach. The findings confirm a Backward-J-shaped demonstration effect, implying that an increase in relative income induces a steeper reduction in Average Propensity to Consume (APC) at lower-income groups (the demonstration effect is stronger for lower-income groups). The results also support the ratchet effect, indicating the importance of past consumption habits for current consumption decisions. In resolving the consumption puzzle, the presence of demonstration and ratchet effects reflects a stable APC in the long run. Therefore, consumption-related policies should be carefully designed, as policies aimed at boosting aggregate demand can motivate low-income households to gallop into a wasteful competition to ‘keep up with the Joneses’—the relative riches.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40847-022-00182-4,Keeping up with the Joneses: macro-evidence on the relevance of Duesenberry’s relative income hypothesis in Ethiopia*,https://openalex.org/W4293064473

In many countries, policymakers’ main response has been to modernize welfare states by focusing on future-oriented “social investment” policies that focus on creating, mobilizing, and preserving human skills and capabilities. Yet, there is massive variance in the development of social investment strategies. This is the first of two volumes of the World Politics of Social Investment (WOPSI) project, which systematically maps and explains different welfare reform strategies in democratic countries around the world. This volume develops a theory on the political and socioeconomic conditions for the development of social investment policies around the globe and studies the impact of the main explanatory factors on the empirical variety of social investment reforms (and non-social investment reforms). It also proposes a new typology of different welfare reform strategies, distinguishing nine types of social investment strategies depending on their functions (creating, mobilizing, and preserving human skill and capabilities) and their distributive profiles (inclusive, stratified, or targeted) and three types of non-social investment welfare strategies (market liberalism, social protectionism, and basic income). The chapters of this volume are written by leading social policy scholars from different disciplines and countries, who apply the WOPSI global theoretical framework in a range of contexts and policy fields, shedding light on the scope conditions of social investment, as well as political demand- and supply-side drivers of social investment reforms.

In developing this proposal, we seek to address key questions about the feasibility of implementing PI schemes: including their administrative complexity and the criticism that a PI constitutes either an arbitrary and confusing, or invasive and stigmatising, form of basic income.

The approach merged the two formerly separated spheres of income taxation and social security into a single integrated tax-and-transfer scheme. Thereby, the construction of the NIT-scheme followed different objectives than van Parijs’ original idea of an UBI. Instead of just providing the highest feasible basic income, it was tried to increase work incentives (i.e. to lower the transfer reduction rate) and at the same time to secure at least the socio-cultural subsistence level of all members of society, all substitute to the financial feasibility of the scheme. In addition, the values of the necessary parameters were selected in accordance with official laws and regulations in Germany.

A critical question about this attention is whether it amounts to more than “just a fad”. Contesting the label of “fad”, this thesis argues that the contemporary attention to Basic Income emerges through interlinked debates around the social understanding of work and the extent of the State.

This argument is developed from semi-structured interviews with stakeholders who have relevant expertise in and around the Basic Income discourse, as well as thematic analysis of print media discussion of Basic Income in 2015 – 2017.

This thesis examines the significance of the attention through the framework developed by Levitas as the Imaginary Reconstitution of Society. That is, it considers the discourse around Basic Income as fragmentary utopias, containing a mixture of critiques of the present, visions of the future “good society”, and policy proposals to move between the two. This leads to the conclusions that (i) the attention to Basic Income is rather attention to a plurality of Basic Incomes, with different purposes and bases, and (ii) that Basic Income cannot be understood as a policy in isolation, but instead as a part of a broader policy platform.",,"""Basic Income is an idea whose time has come"" : but why here, why now, and in what way?",https://openalex.org/W3093727894

Welfare attitudes literature has shown that support for UBI is higher among left‐wing citizens and those of lower socioeconomic status. However, previous studies have not addressed the mediating role of ideological values such as egalitarianism or meritocratism in supporting UBI. Furthermore, studies have not considered the interactive relationship between ideological and self‐interest motives when studying attitudes toward UBI. Drawing on modernization theory, we propose that individuals' socioeconomic status conditions the role of ideological motivations in shaping support for UBI. To test this hypothesis, we study data from two different surveys conducted in Spain in 2017 ( N = 1958) and 2021 ( N = 2004). Our findings suggest that ideology is a less relevant motivation for supporting UBI among the Spanish citizens of lower socioeconomic status, but it becomes increasingly salient among higher‐status citizens. Among the latter, egalitarian values lead leftists to support UBI, whereas anti‐egalitarian and meritocratic values lead rightists to anti‐UBI positions.

Estimates are rounded to the second significant digit.Scheme 1 could prevent or postpone 200 000 (95% uncertainty interval: 180 000 to 210 000) cases of anxiety and depression from 2010 to 2030. This would increase to 420 000(400 000 to 440 000) for Scheme 2 and 550 000(520 000 to 570 000) for Scheme 3. Assuming that 50% of the cases are diagnosed and treated, Scheme 1 could save £330 million (£280 million to £390 million) to National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS), over the same period, with Scheme 2 (£710 million (£640 million to £790 million)) or Scheme 3 (£930 million (£850 million to £1000 million)) producing more considerable savings. Overall, total cost savings (including NHS, PSS and patients' related costs) would range from £1.5 billion (£1.2 billion to £1.8 billion) for Scheme 1 to £4.2 billion (£3.7 billion to £4.6 billion) for Scheme 3.Our modelling suggests that UBI could substantially benefit young people's mental health, producing substantial health-related cost savings.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-075831,Quantifying the mental health and economic impacts of prospective Universal Basic Income schemes among young people in the UK: a microsimulation modelling study,https://openalex.org/W4387328244

Using 2015 tax and transfer parameters and estimates of income and population, we assess the federal transfer system as a source of universal income security, identify the revenues that can be raised through the elimination of selected federal tax credits, present four options that could be financed within that budget constraint, assess their performance, and select our preferred universal basic guaranteed income (UGBI) option. We then provide a more detailed assessment of the impact of our preferred UGBI design and discuss the extension of that design to provincial tax and transfer systems.

I also argue that these beliefs can be sorted into two dichotomies: one concerned with the suitability of remuneration for caregiving, the other with the question of who should be responsible for caregiving.

A UBI is a system of direct monetary payments from government coffers to all citizens of a state or locality with the purpose of providing a sum for essential livelihood. In contrast to most current social welfare programs, the UBI requires no means test for the citizen to become a recipient. This idea has attracted attention for the radical simplicity of its design and implementation. Beginning with a discussion of the principles of the UBI, the paper then analyzes how Basic Income compares with other programs of a similar nature. Discussion then moves to a brief review of case studies of UBI and the positive social and economic outcomes observed in those experiments. Theoretical benefits including public and private efficiency gains, reduced governmental administrative costs, and increased labor market mobility are explained along with an assertion on the morality of welfare as it relates to egalitarian ideals.

Commonly known as social assistance or as safety-nets, these schemes provide income protection for those in need and marginalised income groups. They are the most evident expression of societal commitment that all individuals are entitled to a dignified existence and that no one should experience unwanted need. Minimum income schemes are schemes that provide financial safety-nets for people with income below the national social minimum. Because of their subsidiary nature, minimum income schemes are only available for those who are no longer eligible for other forms of income protection. Unlike categorical social assistance, minimum income schemes are universal, hence they are not targeted to particular groups or social risks. And unlike social insurance which provides insurance-based protection against work-related and social risks, minimum income schemes are a non-contributory form of protection. This introductory chapter provides an overview of the minimum income schemes and the provisions of safety-nets across Europe. It examines the convergence and divergence of the provisions of minimum income schemes in countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK. The chapter also discusses the changes and the transformations that changed the mission and objectives of minimum income schemes in Europe. Among the causal factors are the debates on minimum income schemes across the Atlantic and the rise of unemployment between the 1980s and the 1990s. To fully understand the impact of activation on the role and nature of minimum income schemes, the chapter looks at how this has been implemented. It discusses the meaning of activation, the activation tools, and the activation of minimum income recipients. The chapter ends by outlining the concerns of the succeeding chapters.",https://doi.org/10.1332/policypress/9781847420466.003.0001,Introduction,https://openalex.org/W4243950659

The conflict materializes itself in the problem of designing a basic income (or negative income tax) system which requires formulating a workable compromise.

The solution describes a simple basic income system and its comparative statics indicate how the specification of the objective function leads to a more, or less, pro‐poor solution.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jpet.12074,Designing a Basic Income System with a Social Welfare Function,https://openalex.org/W2136661923

Taking into account the real possibilities of the Russian economy, the issues of developing models of transitional forms of UBI, the so-called “basic income (BI)” are considered for target categories of citizens. The substantiation of the possibility and expediency of modeling the effects of BI payments according to the domestic simulation model of reproduction of Russia’s GDP P1–4–2 (2022–8) is carried out. The results of predictive calculations based on this model are presented. It is shown that the additional revenues of the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation not only compensate for the initial costs of implementing the BI program, but also exceed the initial costs annually. The conclusion is made about the reality of the implementation of the “BI program” in our country. The state leadership is proposed to combine the current system of targeted social support with the introduction of BI payments to the most vulnerable households and categories of Russian citizens in order to improve the level and quality of life of the Russian population and increase consumer demand.",https://doi.org/10.26794/2220-6469-2022-16-3-37-52,"Modeling the payment of basic income to overcome absolute monetary poverty, support unemployed citizens and families with children",https://openalex.org/W4306154095

While it does include a number of progressive policy reforms, the overall direction is at best inadequate and at worst unjust.

The most radical version of negative income tax is a ‘basic income/flat tax’ system which combines universal tax credits (that vary according to presence of children, disability etc.) and a flat tax rate on private income. Using NATSEM’s microsimulation model STINMOD it is found that to ensure that no current social security beneficiaries become worse off under such a system would either be very expensive to introduce or require a tax rate that is likely to be unacceptably high. Less radical versions of negative income tax are also costed, incorporating the possibility of varying tax rates, the tapering out of tax credits, and placing some restrictions on the granting of tax credits. This makes negative income tax look more feasible. The analysis does not incorporate behavioural responses.

In study 1 ( n = 802, April 2020), people expressed much stronger support for a UBI policy for the times of the pandemic and its aftermath than for normal times. This was largely explained by the increased importance they attached, in the pandemic context, to a system that is simple and efficient to administer, and that reduces stress and anxiety in society. In study 2 ( n = 400, May 2020), we pitted UBI against a conditional targeted social transfer system. Preferences for UBI were stronger for pandemic times than for normal times. This was partially explained by a number of perceived advantages, such as simplicity of administration and suitability for a changing world. In study 3 ( n = 397, September 2020), we found that the headline results of studies 1 and 2 persisted six months after the onset of the pandemic, albeit with attenuated effect sizes.

The experiment, implemented in 2017–2018, aimed to improve citizens’ employment and well-being by reducing the eligibility conditions of basic social benefits and by increasing monetary incentives to find employment. The data on attitudes come from responses to a survey carried out during the experiment. Identical questions were posed to the treatment (receiving the BI) and the control group of the experiment. The contributions of this paper are (1) an estimation of the relationship between participation and opinions on BI, (2) an analysis of the heterogeneity of the relationship and (3) an estimation of the relationship between participation and people’s ability to express their opinions on BI.

Believing that it takes something to replace something, this article assess two different progressive strategies for eliminating poverty and promoting individual freedom that could serve as replacements for existing public assistance regimes. The first proposal is that all members of society be guaranteed an unconditional basic income without imposing any work requirements in exchange for the benefit. Such a benefit could be provided either in the form of an unconditional grant paid to all members of society (the form preferred by most advocates of the idea) or a negative income tax. Supporters of this strategy have suggested that a basic income guarantee set at or above the poverty level could replace not only the means-tested public assistance regime that is the principal target of the proposal, but most other government transfer programs as well. The proposal also is promoted as a solution to the problem of unemployment, a means of compensating the many millions of people (mostly women) who perform unpaid family care and community service work, and as a way of enhancing individual freedom and personal development. The second proposal is an updated version of the social welfare strategy that dominated progressive thinking in market societies from the end of World War II through the mid 1970s. In its earlier incarnation, this strategy combined the use of Keynesian macroeconomic policy to 2 achieve full employment with the use of social insurance programs to guarantee income security for individuals or families that were either unable or not expected to be self-supporting. The version of this strategy considered in this article would be similar except that it would supplement continuing efforts to achieve full employment in the regular labor market with the use of direct job creation by government to close any remaining job gap – thereby insuring the availability of enough jobs to provide decent paid employment for all job seekers. I refer to this as the employment assurance strategy in deference to New Deal social welfare planners who first proposed it in the United States. The cost of these two strategies of eliminating poverty in the United States is compared along with their relative merits in achieving other progressive goals. In undertaking the latter evaluation, the economic and social provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are used as an assessment criterion. The principal conclusions drawn are that the basic income strategy would be far more expensive than the employment assurance strategy, that it would not provide an adequate substitute for securing the right to work recognized in the Universal Declaration, and that most of the other benefits the basic income strategy would produce could be more fully achieved at lower cost by using the employment assurance strategy combined with conventional social insurance.

This conclusion follows from a three-part argument. First, if a guaranteed income is in place, all individuals have the same opportunity to live without working. Therefore, those who choose not to work do not take advantage of a privilege that is unavailable to everyone else. Second, in the absence of an unconditional income, society is, in effect, applying the principle He who does not work, will not eat. If the application of this principle is to be consistent with reciprocity, it must be applied to everyone. Most modern industrial societies exempt many citizens from that choice. For example, the owners of external assets do not face the work-or-starve choice and do take advantage of a privilege that is not available to others. An unconditional guaranteed income is one way to eliminate that violation of reciprocity.

We illustrate each of these observations empirically, using cross-nationally comparable data on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) and minimum income protection levels (CSB-MIPI). Since a harmonised minimum income scheme requires a significantly greater budgetary effort on behalf of some of the poorer Member States in Eastern and Southern Europe, it raises a complex question about the meaning of solidarity within the EU. Enhanced solidarity within Member States cannot be decoupled from enhanced solidarity among Member States - and vice versa. Simultaneously, the EU should put positive pressure on poorer and richer Member States to gradually improve the overall quality and efficiency of their welfare regimes. In this context, the prospect of gradually and flexibly introducing a more binding EU framework on minimum income protection may become realistic.",,The EU and Minimum Income Protection: Clarifying the Policy Conundrum,https://openalex.org/W3125261561

While many countries currently adopt need-based programmes, the idea of introducing a UBI programme has been discussed politically in several countries. For instance, The Opportunity Party in New Zealand proposed paying NZ$13,000 per year to every adult citizen as basic income. Unless the amount of transfer per person decreases under the new programme, the government will have to increase tax rates.

Grounded on a loss of faith in the ability of market societies to provide decent paid employment for everyone who needs it, BI advocates promote the BI idea as a more direct and environmentally friendly way of eradicating poverty and a more equitable and liberating way of ensuring everyone’s right to pursue personally rewarding work. In this paper I argue that BI advocates have been too ready to reject the conventional definition of the right to work, too willing to embrace the assumption that it cannot be secured by reasonable means, and too quick to conclude that a BI guarantee would provide an adequate substitute for it. I do not, however, reject the BI idea. Rather than viewing it as a substitute for securing the right to work, I argue that it should be seen as a foundation for policies designed to secure what I refer to as the right to income support.

The article argues that the social democratic policy of full employment implies an increasingly tough work orientation that is challenging to reconcile with de-commodifying social rights, which has characterized social democratic welfare states. It is further argued that a strict reciprocity-based policy has not proven effective in getting people into work on a permanent basis, and that the current challenges require new policy ideas. Two alternatives are discussed: guaranteed jobs and a basic income. The article argues that the lack of enthusiasm for the last option among social democrats is based on the misconception that a basic income will harm people's motivation to work, their self-respect, the social economy and the principle of justice.

By interpreting this experiment through a Bourdieusian lens, we identify five key themes that are helpful in understanding income tax design, tax fairness, and the role played by political elites. Overall, we contribute to the literature by highlighting the way in which cultural capital may be used by political elites to reformulate groups of taxpayers in order to justify unequal treatment of equal taxpayers, which represents a violation of the notion of horizontal equity (fairness).

Capitalist ideals that emphasize individual effort, competition, and financial prosperity have spurred tremendous economic growth but underestimate human motivation and have implications for human wellbeing. The aim of this essay is to examine the implications of guaranteed basic income based on existing data from the perspective of self‐determination theory, a humanistic theory of motivation that considers both practical performance‐related outcomes as well as human flourishing. I discuss the motivational dynamics involved in labour participation rates, how basic income may impact basic psychological needs and wellbeing, how basic income may impact workplace environments, and whether neoliberal capitalist values are a useful framework through which to discuss basic income. From this perspective, the benefits of basic income to individuals and society are promising. A shift in values from hyper‐rational competitive ideologies towards more humanistic frameworks such as self‐determination theory may be beneficial for not only for basic income and management research, but also the evaluation of public policy.",https://doi.org/10.1111/joms.13075,Guaranteed Basic Income from the Perspective of Self‐Determination Theory,https://openalex.org/W4394694620

Simultaneously, cash-based welfare policies have frayed, support for public assistance has fallen on the political right, and prejudice against recipients of welfare has remained high. Yet, in recent years Universal Basic Income (UBI) has gained traction, a policy proposing to give all citizens cash sufficient to meet basic needs with no strings attached. We hypothesized that UBI can mitigate the partisanship and prejudice that define the existing welfare paradigm in the US but that this potential depends critically on the narratives attached to it. Indeed, across three online experiments with US adults (total N = 1888), we found that communicating the novel policy features of UBI alone were not sufficient to achieve bipartisan support for UBI or overcome negative stereotyping of its recipients. However, when UBI was described as advancing the more conservative value of financial freedom, conservatives perceived the policy to be more aligned with their values and were less opposed to the policy (meta-analytic effect on policy support: d = 0.36 [95% CI: 0.27 to 0.46]). Extending the literatures on moral reframing and cultural match, we further find that this values-aligned policy narrative mitigated prejudice among conservatives, reducing negative welfare-related stereotyping of policy recipients (meta-analytic effect d = −0.27 [95% CI: −0.38 to −0.16]), while increasing affiliation with them. Together, these findings point to moral reframing as a promising means by which institutional narratives can be used to bridge partisan divides and reduce prejudice.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2022.104424,Mitigating welfare-related prejudice and partisanship among U.S. conservatives with moral reframing of a universal basic income policy,https://openalex.org/W4309735605

Alternative theories, however, argue that the acceptance of low income work will reduce job search intensity and can signal low productivity, and therefore will not enable people to support themselves. Using longitudinal administrative data and discrete time linear probability models, we follow all social assistance recipients in the Netherlands from 2010 to 2015, and analyse whether, and for whom, low income work functions as a stepping stone towards sustainable self-sufficiency. We find that social assistance recipients are more likely to become self-sufficient when they are active in low income work. This stepping stone effect applies in particular to benefit recipients with limited work experience, a higher educational level, a shorter duration of welfare receipt and to those who belong to the native Dutch majority. The type of employment also matters: low income work through temporary employment agencies is found to be the most effective stepping stone towards self-sufficiency.",https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcab003,From Social Assistance to Self-Sufficiency: Low Income Work as a Stepping Stone,https://openalex.org/W3131697392

40.59738,-27.649353,3,"The idea that every member of society should be granted an individual, unconditional, and sufficient cash payment has attracted much attention over the last few years. Initially viewed merely as a utopian idea upheld by a handful of scholars, Universal Basic Income (UBI) is now considered a policy proposal with real chances of being implemented.1 Beyond academia, UBI is attracting the attention of politicians, policymakers, and the public in general, who usually understand it as a tool to reinforce traditional social protection systems. Nevertheless, it is also seen as a core element of a new rationale for future welfare regimes: less targeted, more universal, less strings-attached, more unconditional. After several decades discussing theories of justice and normative principles justifying UBI,2 the debate is now turning towards its empirical and policymaking challenges. The limitations and pitfalls of traditional conditional cash transfer policies and means-tested benefits have clearly contributed towards advancing the idea of UBI. As these limitations have come into sharper focus, several governments worldwide have realized these policies are not well-equipped to eliminate new forms of poverty and social exclusion and hence they are exploring innovative policies to deal with these problems. In doing so, many governments are giving priority to so-called “evidence-based policies,” a research-based policymaking agenda, under the auspices of international institutions. So far, some experiments on UBI (or quasi-UBI) schemes have been conducted in places such as Namibia, Finland, Barcelona, the Netherlands, Canada, Iran, and India. Others are still running in the USA, Kenya, Uganda, Macau, Brazil, and South Korea, while others are being designed in Germany, France, Wales, Scotland, and Catalonia, to mention just a few. Previous experiments with Negative Income Tax schemes in the USA and in Canada in the 1970s and 1980s provided important insights on topics such as fiscal effects (Widerquist, 2005), health, well-being, happiness, and community engagement (Forget, 2011). Current policymakers, however, need to assess the potential effects of UBI in markedly different economic, social, and political scenarios to those studied in North America 40 or 50 years ago. While it is true that evidence may be obtained from lab experiments (Deaton, 2004; Levitt & List, 2007) or microsimulations (Arcarons, Raventós, & Torrens, 2014; Gamel, Balsan, & Vero, 2006), more robust evidence, at both individual and societal levels, is expected to be obtained from larger-scale field experiments such as randomized controlled trials and saturation studies (de Groot, 2006; Gelman, 2014; Virjo, 2006). However, the initial wave of enthusiasm for these experiments is now giving way to more skeptical positions that contest the advisability of continuing to carry out such experiments or pilot projects. Have we not already gathered enough empirical evidence to illustrate the benefits of UBI? If the goal is to implement it, is it really necessary therefore to continue experimenting? In what follows, I will first set out three reasons why I believe it is not necessary to continue experimenting with UBI. I will then argue that this question is not adequate, not least because it generates a sterile debate for discussion and policymaking. The hypothesis that I will finally defend is that experiments are indeed useful in advancing towards the adoption of the UBI, within certain epistemic and political parameters. If the question is whether experiments are necessary to justify UBI, the answer is No, they are not. Of all the possible reasons for this answer, I will focus on the three that I think are most suggestive for the debate at hand. As well as unnecessary, experiments can be counterproductive (Torry, 2021). They can be a distracting factor for UBI activists by taking time and effort away from their mobilization and lobbying campaigns. They can also hamper political processes and dynamics. By prioritizing the logic of evidence gathering and scientific evaluation, the parameters with which political processes usually operate may be altered or even replaced by a dynamic in which traditional political agents (parties, trade unions, social movements, the general public, etc.) lose their capacity for advocacy in favor of “scientific” procedures that are apparently neutral, conflict-averse, and therefore limited to a few “non-political” experts. Experiments can even be harmful. When results are not properly interpreted or communicated, they can end up hindering the advancement of UBI. This is what had supposedly happened in the USA in the 1970s (Lenkowsky, 1986; Widerquist, 2005) and in Finland, where a poor pedagogy of results cut short the debate that had been growing in the country by presenting UBI as a “thoroughly wrongheaded idea” (Ezrati, 2019). Beyond the negative or counterproductive effects on the policymaking process or deficiencies in the communication and dissemination of experimental results, the main justification for UBI stems from ethical arguments that need not (and cannot) be empirically tested. As I have argued on other occasions (Laín, 2021), poverty, like slavery, threatens people's dignity. It follows that the justification of UBI, like the abolition of slavery, does not rely on the provision of more or less empirical evidence, but on the fact that it is an ethically desirable measure as it has the capacity to remove a phenomenon—poverty—that we socially identify as degrading to human dignity. There may always be other measures capable of responding to the moral challenge poverty poses to our societies, but this does not undermine the ethical desirability of UBI. In short, as Guy Standing (2021, p. 77) argues, “the fundamental justifications for basic income are ethical.” Debates on the epistemic status of scientific knowledge are as old as science itself, and UBI experiments are no exception (Knobe & Nichols, 2008; Teele, 2014). Experiments based on controlled randomization are criticized for not being able to replicate their results or adhere to the principle of generalizability (Deaton, 2014; Deaton & Cartwright, 2018). In addition, as there are always non-parameterizable social, economic, political, or cultural factors at play, their internal methodological validity is very weak (Banerjee & Duflo, 2014). As an alternative, arguments are made for the epistemic superiority of the results obtained in laboratory experiments or microsimulations (Levitt & List, 2007). The problem is that their supposedly greater internal validity is based on an “artificial environment” (Noguera & De Wispelaere, 2006) construed from the scientists’ assumptions on the socio-institutional parameters and the behavioral responses that the agents will hypothetically adopt within it. Thus, there is always an epistemic-methodological trade-off: while “laboratory experiments have higher internal validity, field experiments have higher external validity” (Füllbrunn, Delsen, & Vyrastekova, 2019, p. 179). In conclusion, the problem is that the epistemic validity of the experimental results will never be robust enough to justify UBI from a strict “evidence-based policy” point of view (Laín & Merrill, 2021). Based on these three objections, (i) the counterproductive effects of the experiments, (ii) the superiority of ethical reasons, and (iii) the poor epistemic robustness of the results, it can be argued that experiments are not necessary to justify UBI. However, the evidence shows that there is some acceptance of the idea of UBI in countries where experiments have been carried out, suggesting that they are precisely the countries where such a policy may have greater chance of being implemented (Perkiö, Rincón, & van Draanen, 2019; Simanainen & Kangas, 2020). This suggests that the question we should be asking is not whether experiments are necessary, but rather whether they are useful and to what extent. This new question, more fruitful for social analysis and policymaking, allows for more precise identification of the most relevant causal factors in identifying and understanding the prospects of UBI in each country. In this sense, we can identify two major areas in which experiments are or can be useful in justifying the adoption of a measure such as UBI. From a strictly scientific perspective, experiments can be expected to be useful to the extent that their results are positive and meaningful enough to convince those who do not have an existing opinion about UBI, and those reticent but willing to change their minds if the evidence is sufficiently compelling. However, although the qualitative effects of most experiments have generally been more significant and conclusive than the effects on the labor market, the latter continue to capture almost all the social and media attention. Indeed, labor participation always “attracts attention because it is a nice, neat, apparently-easy-to-understand number” (Widerquist, 2018, p. 117). This asymmetry in the social perception of the results suggests the limited usefulness of empirical evidence and “purely scientific” reasoning as the main mechanisms to justify the implementation of UBI. Indeed, “although some important disagreements about UBI's effects exist, the disagreement is more of an ethical debate about the desirability of its effects than an empirical debate about what those effects are” (Widerquist, 2018, p. 87). Let's face it: the evidence experiments provide will never be enough to convince anyone who is opposed to UBI for ethical or ideological reasons. Discussions about experiments are not so much about the validity or significance of their results but “on the ethical desirability of UBI's known effects” (Widerquist, 2018, p. 14). This leads us to conclude that: (i) experiments can be useful in justifying UBI to the extent that they obtain significant evidence but, (ii) such usefulness is restricted to those who heed logical reasons and scientific evidence. The problem is that the debate on experiments is rarely defined by calm and reasoned argumentation. After all, experiments and the entire set of “social policies are to be judged by ethical principles” (Davala et al., 2015, p. 11). The fact that evidence cannot be separated from its ethical and political implications compels us to discuss some of the central issues of our welfare states. To what extent should employment be the main means of livelihood? Should we be obliged to perform any given task in return for social assistance? To what extent should material existence be an unconditional right? Does unconditionality contradict reciprocity? Faced with these (and other) questions, it is illusory to view experiments as purely and strictly scientific endeavors while disregarding their inevitable ethical and political implications. Hence, experiments would be better understood as a “source of political strategy or as an advocacy tool, than [simply] as a source of politically-neutral findings that inform academic debates” (Neves, 2021, p. 27). Spelling out the political nature of experiments allows us to discover the second role that they can play in furthering the adoption of UBI. If the aim of an experiment is not simply to extract scientific evidence in a “politically neutral” way to determine the pros and cons of UBI, but to implement it by sheer political will, the experiment can be useful in establishing the best way to achieve this while minimizing the setbacks that may arise as a result of tailoring the policy to each institutional, economic, and political environment. For example, the abruptly cancelled Finnish experiment shows us to what extent UBI experiments are “political” endeavors rather than just “scientific” projects, and therefore they rely on the same political problems and policy challenges (De Wispelaere, Halmetoja, & Pilkka, 2018). The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) in California illustrates how a municipal UBI could coexist with other state or federal conditional aid programs and how they could be made compatible in certain groups (Baker et al., 2020). As the B-MINCOME in Barcelona has shown, experiments can also be useful in suggesting to what extent a national UBI could be made compatible with other much more focused benefits, such as municipal child benefits (Todeschini & Sabes-Figuera, 2019). Likewise, a saturation experiment that emulates the universality of UBI in a specific region or town, as in the case of Otjivero-Omitara in Namibia, is very informative on the supposed “pull effect” attributed to UBI and how it can lead to positive outcomes for depopulated regions (Haarmann, Haarmann, & Nattrass, 2019; Merrill, Neves, & Laín, 2021). The universality of Iran's policy makes it possible to foresee and eventually readjust the design of a UBI so that it does not reinforce traditional gender roles and the subordination of women.3 The case of Barcelona is also useful in predicting institutional arrangements that could be necessary to mitigate negative externalities that may arise from the universality of UBI, such as controlling the price elasticity of the real estate market in specific urban areas (Esmkhani, Favilukis, & Van Nieuwerburgh, 2021; Goodman & Danson, 2019). Similarly, the gradual universalization of the number of renda básica recipients in Maricá, Brazil (currently about 50,000; more than a quarter of the state's population) and the broad support it has generated, have made Bolsonaro's attempt to eliminate the program too politically costly (Lavinas, 2020). As these and other examples show, discovering the political utility of experimentation with UBI allows us to shed light on some of the problems, contradictions and also potentialities of our welfare states, and this can only benefit the debate about UBI. The counterproductive effects, the superiority of ethical justification, or the poor epistemic robustness of the results call into question the need for experiments to justify the adoption of UBI. However, this does not deny they can be useful. The empirical evidence they provide can play an important a role. Admittedly, however, this evidence may be epistemically weak and therefore only convincing for those willing to change their minds for compelling reasons. However, while such evidence may be of little use in “scientifically” persuading those opposing UBI for ethical or ideological reasons, recognizing such a limitation allows us to discover the “political utility” of experimentation. On the one hand, it helps us to foresee the challenges or setbacks an eventual adoption of UBI may face in each institutional, political, and economic environment and, on the other, it invites us to debate the nature and functioning of current welfare states.

Using the 2016 European Social Survey, we investigate how trade union membership and left political ideology (central to power resources theory) and attitudes towards immigrants’ access to welfare benefits (central to welfare state chauvinism) affect individual support for a UBI. We also investigate how country-level differences in levels of social spending moderate individual-level UBI support. Results from multi-level models suggest that a broader coalition of UBI supporters can generally be found in countries where social spending is low. Specifically, we find that welfare state chauvinism is more likely to be associated with negative attitudes towards a UBI in countries with high levels of spending, but has only a weak association with UBI support in low-spending countries. Similarly, political ideology is more consequential in explaining UBI support in countries with higher levels of spending. These tensions form a demand–capacity paradox: the countries which are presumably least equipped to implement a UBI see the most broad-based support for the policy.",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/fvh92,Support for a Universal Basic Income: A Demand-Capacity Paradox?,https://openalex.org/W3157956999

Workers with earnings at least equivalent to 16 hours at the minimum wage would be entitled to 100 percent of the MBM. We also investigate the impact of three alternative proposals: (a) a change in the above hours cut-off from 16 to 30 hours; (b) a guaranteed income equal to 100 percent of the MBM, irrespective of earnings; and (c) a $3/hour conditional wage subsidy. To do this, we first estimate a structural labour supply model using the existing tax code and predict the labour supply of a representative sample of individuals based upon the parameter estimates of the model. Simulations show that the original recommendation would have strong negative impacts on participation rates of low earners and that its cost would exceed $2 billion. Increasing the hours cut-off is predicted to have little impact beyond that of the original recommendation. Providing a guaranteed income equivalent to 100 percent of the MBM, on the other hand, would have a large impact.

This social assistance scheme is regarded as an alternative to traditional targeted, means-tested, social benefits. The paper elaborates on what distinguishes universal basic income from other forms of social benefits, and analyzes some of the most widespread arguments in its favor. A hypothetical implementation of basic income could not only generate social and economic gains, but would also inevitably be associated with certain costs. In particular, given that for some individuals with medium and high incomes basic income payments would in essence be a tax deduction, taxes would need to be raised in order to balance out the state budget. This would lead to additional administration costs. As demonstrated in the article, they should be interpreted as costs of reduction of information asymmetry, which inevitably arises in the relation between the state and recipients of social assistance. It is shown that the economic side of a number of key arguments for basic income boils down to the latter making it possible to reduce information asymmetry. These arguments include the assertions that universal basic income would make the welfare system simpler and more manageable, eliminate poverty traps and expand the freedom of choice among social benefit recipients. The information asymmetry approach is applied to the analysis of preliminary results of the basic income experiment conducted in Finland in 2017–2018.

We simulated the MH effects of UBI on UK working-age adults. Methods Adults aged 25-64 were simulated from 2022-26 with the SimPaths microsimulation model, using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study. SimPaths models short-term MH effects of UK tax/benefit policies via income, poverty and employment transitions. Three counterfactual UBI scenarios were modelled from 2023: ‘Partial’ (value equivalent to existing benefits), ‘Full’ (equivalent to the UK Minimum Income Standard) and ‘Full+’ (retained some means-tested benefits). Likely common mental disorder (CMD) was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, score ≥4) and stratified by gender, education, and household structure. Simulations were run 1,000 times to generate 95% uncertainty intervals. Sensitivity analyses relaxed SimPaths assumptions about reduced employment resulting from Full/Full+ UBI. Results Partial UBI had little impact on poverty, employment or MH. Full UBI scenarios practically eradicated poverty, but decreased employment. Full+ UBI increased CMD prevalence by 0.38% points (0.13-0.69), equivalent to 157,951 additional CMD cases (54,036-286,805); effects were largest for men (0.63% [0.31-1.01]) and those with children (0.64% [0.18-1.14]). In our sensitivity analysis assuming minimal UBI-related employment impacts, CMD prevalence instead fell by 0.27% (-0.49, -0.05), a reduction of 112,228 cases (20,783-203,673); effects were largest for women (-0.32% [-0.65, 0.00]), those without children (-0.40 [-0.68, -0.15]) and those with least education (-0.42% [-0.97, 0.15]). MH effects waned by 2026 in all modelled scenarios. Conclusions UBI has potential to improve short-term population MH by reducing poverty, but impacts may be highly contingent on whether individuals choose to remain in employment following its introduction. Key messages • A UBI meeting living costs may slightly improve population mental health if people continue working after receiving the benefit, especially for women, the least educated, and those without children. • In a ‘worst-case scenario’, where the increased income led to maximal reductions in employment, UBI might instead worsen short-term mental health, especially for men and those with children.",https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckad160.886,How might a Universal Basic Income influence UK mental health?

The system has been characterized as one that discourages work, undermines the family, and perpetuates dependence. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many experts believed that the negative income tax represented a simple and desirable alternative to the existing programs. The complex set of cash and in-kind benefits paid to certain categories of the poor would be replaced with a single guaranteed income payment for all poor families that would gradually diminish as earnings increased. Congress, however, was extremely reluctant to enact such a plan. One reason for the political opposition was the widespread fear that a guaranteed income would reduce the work effort of poor breadwinners and, as a result, cost taxpayers a great deal of money. In an effort to gain some knowledge about the potential impact of a guaranteed income on labor force activity, the federal government in the late 1960s and 1970s sponsored four large-scale social experiments to measure individuals’ responses to different levels of benefits and tax rates. Although the negative income tax itself has fallen from favor, the labor supply question and the other basic issues studied in these experiments are still relevant to the current social welfare debates. Architects of new programs need to know the effects of particular reforms on work effort, family stability, housing, food consumption and the well-being of dependent children.

This paper evaluates the effect of the PFD to mitigate poverty among the state's rural Indigenous (Alaska Native) peoples: a population with historically high poverty rates living in a region with limited economic opportunities. Errors in recording PFD income in data used to calculate official poverty statistics cause them to misrepresent poverty in Alaska and understate the effect of the PFD. Estimating poverty rates with and without PFD income therefore requires reconstruction of family incomes from household-level data. Estimated poverty rates from reconstructed income show that the PFD has had a substantial, although diminishing mitigating effect on poverty for rural Indigenous families. The PFD has had a larger effect on poverty among children and elders than for the rural Alaska Native population as a whole.

Differences in redistributive views are significant between three groups of nations. Labor supply responses are systematically larger at the extensive margin and often larger for the lowest earnings groups, exacerbating the implicit Rawlsian views for countries with traditional social assistance programs.

A relaxed, non-obligatory ethos might avoid this implication.

20.59347,1.7914847,2,"24 | International Union Rights | 27/3 FOCUS | IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON WORK AND THE CHALLENGE FOR UNION RIGHTS Universal Basic Income – not really an alternative The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) sounds intriguing at first: everyone should be guaranteed an income which covers their basic needs. Who would argue with that? Taking a closer look, however, there is much uncertainty as to what exactly is meant and how a UBI should work and be financed. This was also evident during the Covid 19 pandemic, when proposals were made to use a temporary basic income to cushion the economic consequences for the population and especially its particularly vulnerable sections. For example a study for the United Nations Development Programme proposed this for the world’s three billion poorest people. But this would be neither universal nor sufficient – in average US$ 2.50 per person per day. In the paper there is also a positive reference to Spain, where a ‘basic income’ was introduced. There it concerns however an even worse Spanish variant of the German model of basic security for needy unemployed (‘Hartz IV’), which is criticised by the trade unions as too low and too repressive. UBI as a rescue against the crisis? For Germany this discussion makes little sense. This is a country with a highly developed social welfare system, which showed its performance in the ongoing crisis – despite of all problems and legitimate criticisms. This system is characterised by social insurance schemes, which involve the vast majority of the population – in particular, dependent employees and their families – which provide benefits on the basis of contributions paid. Especially, the short-time work allowance saved millions from falling into unemployment. But nevertheless many mini-jobbers, self-employed and small entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit. They often have low incomes anyway and need every euro, but do not receive short-time work benefits or unemployment benefits because they are not covered by unemployment insurance. If they are needy, they can apply for basic security, but this is below the German poverty line. For the German UBI community this is rather a deterrent example, they see a ‘real UBI’ as the fundamental alternative to this means-tested basic provision. A UBI as they mean it is intended to be an income that the government pays unconditionally to each person, regardless of what income that person receives or what assets they possess. There is no means testing and each person receives the same amount (only children less). The UBI should be high enough to cover basic needs and guarantee social participation. The search for gainful employment would not be required. As a response to the Covid 19 crisis more than 400,000 people supported a petition that demands the introduction of an unconditional basic income of 800-1200 euro per person and month in Germany for 6 months. This would cost about 500 billion euro, which would be 3 or 4 times the complete public expenditure on education. But why should everyone receive such an unconditional basic income (BGE) as a measure against the crisis, although for many, fortunately the majority of employees, the income is not at all lost, but continues as before? For the majority of the employees hit by the crisis the short-time work allowance or even the unemployment benefit is better than such a UBI would be. On the other hand, such an UBI would not be a rescue for the many self-employed and small businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy because their income is lost but they still have to pay various running costs, rents, etc. Targeted aid for those who need it would also make more economic sense so that they can get started again after the crisis. And this would be far less expensive because far fewer people than the entire population would receive it. Arguments against demands for a UBI In principle, the various arguments that speak against a UBI also apply to a corona crisis UBI. Why should the vast majority of the population receive this money, although they do not need it at all? Why should everyone get the same amount, no matter how high their...",https://doi.org/10.1353/iur.2020.a838153,Universal Basic Income - not really an alternative,https://openalex.org/W4379621329

In spite of the apparent appeal, however, UBI faces a discursive and political stalemate that seems hard to overcome. In an attempt to understand this tension, we explore the discursive coalitions surrounding UBI in a debate on Dutch Twitter. We use discourse network analysis to (a) cluster discussants endorsing similar positions and (b) see which political elites endorse these positions. We find that the known schism between the liberal and egalitarian interpretations of UBI is driven by ambivalence towards its redistributive implications. Moreover, we observe a turn towards social investment frames amongst UBI advocates, who centrally argue that UBI is activating and deregulating social security. This change in framing, however, seems to have little visible impact on elite coalition formation. Green-left elites remain overrepresented amongst proponents, while liberal and conservatives are opposed, and the socialist party remains divided on the issue. Thus, while the implementation of a ‘full’ UBI seems blocked by redistributive concerns, the social investment turn may be the political compromise that explains the popular appeal and political success of UBI inspired experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279422000976,Between left and right: A discourse network analysis of Universal Basic Income on Dutch Twitter,https://openalex.org/W4327947805

In order to demonstrate possible labour supply side reactions to a basic income policy, we use the neoclassical labour supply model and adapt it to our purposes. We compare the effects of implementing a basic income on different types of employees concerning their consumption preferences. We show that, even in the neoclassical labour supply model without intrinsic work motivation, an unconditional basic income increases the participation rate in the labour market. Furthermore, current employees are given only partial incentives to increase their labour supply.

-32.21025,-11.95506,1,"Social security programmes may be divided into two broad groups of programmes, those concerned with income security and those concerned with opportunity security. Income security programmes may be further divided into positive transfer programmes, where there is a cash flow from the government to the individual, and negative transfer programmes, which are a component of the taxation system. Positive transfer programmes may be universal or limited, the main limitation being benefits subject to a means test. Positive transfer programmes may also be classified as to whether they are income based measures, distinguishing between income replacement and income supplement programmes; or whether they are expenditure based, whereby the beneficiary receives either full or partial compensation for expenditure he has made or is assumed to have made. The philosophy lying behind income security programmes may be related to the principle of either individual need or social right. The former principle tends to be associated with programmes which are limited in nature while universal programmes tend to be based on the principle of social right. In the past most of the income security programmes in Australia have been based on the principle of individual need, but since 1972 there has been a marked shift to programmes based on social right, particularly the policy of abolishing the means test on aged pensions and the introduction of Medibank. Social right policies, in general, tend to be more costly and alleviate less need per dollar of outlay than individual need programmes. Apart from the move towards social right programmes, there has been an increasing lack of coordination between existing and proposed programmes. Although an inter-departmental committee has been established to investigate this problem, it is unlikely that any real change will eventuate from that source in the near future. What is required in Australia today is not further studies of poverty or the prescription of new programmes, but an explicit statement of social welfare philosophy on which programmes are to be based, and the establishment of an organisation whose primary and perhaps sole task is to co-ordinate social security programmes.",https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1839-4655.1976.tb00568.x,Income Security Programmes and the Philosophy of Social Security Policy,https://openalex.org/W2561377634

With the advent of ‘Industry 4.0’, Universal Basic Income (UBI) is being cast as a potential ‘buffer’—a social safety net—to the restructuring of organisations, jobs, and economies that are already underway. The Covid‐19 pandemic is providing an additional impetus as governments instigate similar safety nets as employment falls in the wake of the virus. To date, much of the debate concerning UBI has taken place in disciplines outside the auspices of Human Resource Management with most commentary occurring within the spheres of economics and social policy. This conceptual study is one of the first within the human resource management (HRM) field to address the potential impacts of UBI on orientations to work and the management of employees. To do this, we focus on a central underpinning theory within HRM, the psychological contract and how this might be affected by its introduction. Finally, a research agenda is developed that provides options by which we might explore the implications of UBI for the practice of HRM when and if such schemes are implemented.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1748-8583.12348,Analysing the impacts of Universal Basic Income in the changing world of work: Challenges to the psychological contract and a future research agenda,https://openalex.org/W3157799726

In this paper, the notion is considered on the basis of the “economics of liberal egalitarianism”, for which the anchor point is to be found in Rawls’philosophical works. Although he certainly does not support basic income, he still provides an appropriate general framework to consider it, in particular because of the hierarchy of his principles of justice (I). At the third level of this hierarchy, the interpretation of the “difference principle” appeared controversial when applied to the case of the “Malibu surfers”, an illustration thanks to which Van Parijs was able to defend the unconditional nature of basic income (II). There remains the transition from the philosophy to the economics of basic income, which allows considering it as a precise alternative of negative income tax. At this stage, a rereading of Friedman’s intuition on this topic results in seeing basic income as a “universal tax credit” (3).

37.07854,-9.258194,2,"The article describes development of the idea of unconditional basic income in some Nordic countries. There were active discussions in the early 1980s and in 1992&ndash;1994 in Denmark and experiment was conducted on the introduction of unconditional basic income in Finland in 2017&ndash;2018. Basic income has never been seriously considered in Denmark on a practical level. For the first time, interest in basic income arose in Denmark in the 1980s. Once again, the issue of basic income was on the official policy agenda in 1992&ndash;1994, when there was extensive discussion on this issue. In many ways, these debates were associated with the development of the system of unemployment benefits in the country at that time and a number of economic, institutional and political circumstances. The idea of basic income was considered as a fatal blow, either too controversial or unrealistic, showing that it would require considerable money. Thus, by the mid-1990s, this idea was categorically rejected and disappeared forever from the agenda in Denmark. The unconditional basic income in Finland has been discussed for the last 10 years. It was believed that due to the mass robotization and the introduction of artificial intelligence, a huge number of people would lose their jobs in the future, and the universal basic income will force people to accept temporary contract work which ultimately will increase labor mobility and efficiency. By the classical definition unconditional basic income is the regular payment of a certain amount of money to each member of the community without checking the financial situation or the need to do work. The experiment with unconditional basic income in Finland did not fully meet this definition. First, only the unemployed could take part in it. Secondly, the experiment participants continued to receive benefits from other support systems. The authorities decided to focus on the unemployed in order to understand whether unconditional basic income encourages employment. The 2 000 citizens selected by lottery were unemployed, poor, and were between the ages of 25 and 58 years old. They received 560 euros per month, while the payment did not stop even after they found a job. Intermediate results of the experiment were almost completely opposite to the expected. Requests of recipients of basic income to the labor market have only increased. They said they were not ready to grab any job, and made more and more demands. Both for employers and for trade unions such an outcome was an unpleasant surprise. The preliminary results of the experiment with an unconditional basic income showed that in the first year participants in the experiment were looking for a little more actively than other unemployed people. Although the Finnish authorities did not officially comment on anything, all the experts said that the two-year tests showed the project&rsquo;s inconsistency. First, the &ldquo;free&rdquo; money was in fact an unconditional unemployment benefit, that is, there was nothing new in the proposed version of the universal basic income. Secondly, the government did not conceal that the experiment with the basic income was not aimed at reducing the number of the poor or fighting inequality &ndash; its main task was &ldquo;promoting employment&rdquo;. If all citizens received unconditional basic income, additional social spending would be about 5% of GDP. This is a lot, even taking into account the fact that Finland spends about 30% of GDP on social spending. A universal basic income can only be successful if provided on a continuous and universal basis. But it requires a lot of money and higher taxes which most people disagree with.",https://doi.org/10.20542/0131-2227-2020-64-9-48-52,Basic Income in Some Nordic Countries: Theory and Practice,https://openalex.org/W3084065861

The JG involves the government offering a public purpose-oriented job with a fixed hourly wage and job benefits to anyone willing to work. The JG as a bottom-up approach is locally administered but federally funded. As the analytical lens of MMT reveals, a monetarily sovereign government is always able to provide the spending required. Macroeconomically, the JG works as an automatic countercyclical stabilizer and an excellent tool for aggregated demand management, ensuring the economy is continuously operating at full capacity. On top, the JG uses an employed buffer stock approach as a superior means to maintain price stability. Next to its favourable macroeconomic impacts, the JG offers many social benefits, particularly related to continuous employment, working conditions in the private sector, power relations in the labour market and democracy. While the JG and Universal Basic Income (UBI) are often discussed as comparable, competing policy proposals, the JG addresses more macroeconomic and social issues than the UBI does.

This earlier comprehensive retrenchment programme by National transformed the welfare state from one based on the notion that the state would provide for people in need, to a residual welfare state in which people were supposed to seek support from the state only as a last resort. Family income policy was targeted to a narrower group of recipients, the conditions for benefit eligibility were tightened, benefit payments reduced and a discourse of welfare dependency that stigmatised benefit recipients was promoted.

The Labour-led government elected in 2017, despite suggesting it would make radical changes, has made little significant effort to reverse this policy direction.

The major difference would be that most profits and interest generated by the operations of publicly-owned business enterprises would be distributed to the general public as a social dividend proportional to household wage and salary income rather than in proportion to household financial assets. The basis of the comparison is a small-scale but comprehensive computable general equilibrium model, termed the ‘els model’ because it encompasses three primary factors of production: capital management effort e, labor l and saving s. Numerical solutions of the model suggest that the critical issue is the numerical value of a parameter (ν) representing the output elasticity of total capital management effort in the aggregate production function. If this parameter value is relatively low, then profit-oriented market socialism out-performs capitalism. If this parameter value is relatively high, then capitalism out-performs profit-oriented market socialism.

To this end, we have designed an experiment where workers make productive effort decisions, and managers can choose between workers and robots to do these tasks. In our baseline treatment, we measure the effort made by workers who may be replaced by robots, and also elicit firm replacement decisions. Subsequently, we carry out treatments in which workers have a universal basic income of about a fifth of the workers’ median wages, or where there is a tax levy on firms who replace workers by robots. We complete the picture of the impact of automation by looking into the coexistence of workers and robots with part-time jobs. We find that the threat of a robot substitution does not affect the amount of effort exerted by workers. Also, neither universal basic income nor a tax on robots decrease workers’ effort. We observe that the robot substitution tax reduces the probability of worker substitution. Finally, workers that benefit from managerial decisions to not substitute them by more productive robots do not increase their effort level. Our conclusions shed light on the interplay of policy and workers behavior under pervasive automation.",https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-00676-8,"Robots, labor markets, and universal basic income",https://openalex.org/W3111721548

In this essay, this rough conjecture is first presented, and its plausibility probed, on the background of some stylised facts about the rise of modern welfare states in the postwar period. Next, the focus is shifted to the current debate on the introduction of a basic income, a completely unconditional grant paid ex ante to all citizens. It is argued that if basic income is to have a chance of meeting the strong twofold condition stipulated in the conjecture, some major changes are required in the way one usually thinks about justice and efficiency in connection with social policy. But once these changes are made, as they arguably must be, the chance that basic income may be able to meet the challenge is greatly enhanced.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400017827,The Second Marriage of Justice and Efficiency,https://openalex.org/W2003199800

Three solutions are considered using a framework based on the work of Wilcock and Hocking. The first solution is the current approach to dealing with unemployment, which presents a risk to the occupational well-being of individuals if employment is not found. Two alternative solutions - a Job Guarantee (JG) and a Universal Basic Income (UBI) offer some additional opportunities for health through occupation, with the UBI perhaps offering the greatest opportunity for occupation to create health.

Status freedom concerns the distinction between a free person and an unfree person. Continuous freedom concerns the continuum of liberties that make a person more or less free, whether they affect her status as a free person or not. Part One defines a status freedom as effective control self-ownership - the effective power to have and to refuse active cooperation with other willing people. It argues why this concept of freedom is important, situates it among the recent theories of freedom, and examines the conditions necessary to secure it. It concludes that a free person requires at least some unconditional access to property and that basic income is one way to secure that access. Part Two considers what kind of property-rights regime provides the greatest freedom in the continuous sense. It argues that Lockean and right-libertarian property theories fail to establish that full liberal ownership rights are consistent with the greatest freedom for all. It concludes that a payment from property owners to the propertyless in the form of an unconditional basic income from is necessary to establish property rights consistently with maximal equal freedom.

This world ownership, many have supposed, gives all persons a natural right to equal shares of resources and thus a right to an equal basic income under conditions (like our own) in which nearly all resources have been appropriated. This reasoning betrays a misunderstanding of Locke’s conception of original world ownership and, once this understanding is corrected, it becomes clear that there is no natural right to equal shares of resources, although there is a natural right to sufficient shares. Consequently, although governments must guarantee sufficiency for their citizens, there is no Lockean reason why this guarantee must take the form of a basic income or a scheme of equal and unconditional payments.",https://doi.org/10.1515/1932-0183.1217,Locke on Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W1987333443

One common objection to BI has been that it is impossible to design a scheme that simultaneously conforms to these two criteria. In this article, I develop a conceptual framework for analysing the trade-offs that afflict BI policy design. I suggest that while the idea of a policy dilemma between affordability and adequacy does indeed afflict ‘full’ BI schemes, it is possible to design an affordable and adequate ‘partial’ BI scheme. However, this comes at the cost of (at least partly) forfeiting some key advantages that motivate interest in BI in the first place, since these only arise as a consequence of the elimination of means testing and related conditionality from the welfare system. Thus, BI proponents face a three-way trade-off in policy design between affordability, adequacy, and securing the full advantages of BI as a radical simplification of existing welfare policy. The trilemma is illustrated with reference to original microsimulation evidence for the UK, which demonstrates that at most two of the three criteria can be achieved in a single scheme.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279419000424,"A Basic Income Trilemma: Affordability, Adequacy, and the Advantages of Radically Simplified Welfare",https://openalex.org/W2955590095

They were too expensive given new budgetary priorities and implementation was difficult for jurisdictional reasons. Over time, the concept of poverty shifted away from focusing on lack of income towards the lack of resources that cause exclusion and that prevent people from developing their capacities to fully participate in society. Concerns increasingly focused on siloed programs that provided one-size-fits-all benefits, ignoring individual and family diversity. New research paints a different picture of poverty, one where traditional GAI programs are less useful than had been previously assumed. In particular, most periods of lowincome are relatively short, requiring supports that can only be awkwardly met by traditional tax-based GAI designs. As well, for the minority of low-income people who are persistently poor, the best solutions involve integrated mixes of income supports and, often, a variety of services. Yet, despite all the factors above, interest in GAI schemes has increased in recent years. This Commentary briefly reviews current proposals and explains that the resurgence of interest in them likely lies in a deep desire to make things better, in the lack of progress to date in fighting poverty, and in frustration with the inability of existing policy tools to get results. However, the Commentary argues that the effective, and affordable, way ahead lies not in big GAI programs taken in isolation, but rather in the use of newly available technology and data sources to steadily improve three kinds of programming: 1) integrated services tailored to individual needs, such as skill-enhancing programs that are intended to address unique needs of those who are persistently poor; 2) supporting people who can save for occasional periods of low-income by allowing more flexible access to income supports over the course of oneâ€™s life; and, 3) GAI programming that extends existing measures, such as supports directed to children, seniors and those with disabilities. This bottom-up reform based on an evidence-driven approach would have a better chance of succeeding if GAIs are realigned to support this vision.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2925424,Toward a New Balance in Social Policy: The Future Role of Guaranteed Annual Income within the Safety Net,https://openalex.org/W3124003665

The crisis had large repercussions for the welfare of many citizens and it generated cutbacks in virtually all social policy programmes. This halted a welfare‐state expansion that had been going on for decades. It also caused great concern about the state of welfare of the nation. In 1999 the Swedish Government appointed a ‘Welfare Commission’, a team of academic researchers who were assigned the task of drawing up a balance sheet for the development of welfare in the 1990s. The Commission delivered its final report in October 2001. This article is a condensed account of one of the more central issues for the Commission; namely, how the unemployment crisis affected already socially and economically vulnerable groups. Looking at the development over the entire decade, three groups stand out as particularly disadvantaged in terms of individual welfare resources: young adults, immigrants and single mothers. The downturn for these groups was especially accentuated in terms of employment and income. Young people and immigrants trying to get into the labour market during the crisis years faced the problems of newcomers to the systems of social protection. The poor economic development for single mothers could essentially be attributed to the shortage of work in general and of full‐time work in particular that followed from the unemployment crisis. As a consequence, the importance of selective benefits increased and the relative size of all public transfers – despite rationing measures – stayed fairly unchanged. The results highlight the great influence of macroeconomic conditions and policy making for the welfare of vulnerable groups in society.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-2397.00249,Welfare and the unemployment crisis: Sweden in the 1990s,https://openalex.org/W2127881275

These features appear to be crucial in the evaluation of reform effects. The results suggest that there is scope for improving upon the current system under both the efficiency and the equality criterion. The benefits from the reforms, however, come from unexpected directions since the largest labour supply contribution come from poor and middle class households whereas rich households appear to be much less responsive to changes in the tax rates. The simulation results reveal that a crucial role in shaping the results is played by the relatively higher behavioural responsiveness of married women living in low and average income households.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00148-004-0193-2,Do more equal slices shrink the cake?

Those programs tend to be difficult to access, difficult to understand, and difficult to navigate, and are much more a collection of disparate programs than a cohesive and consistent system targeting an overriding objective. As a result, many potentially eligible persons do not apply for programs they might be eligible for, due to a lack of knowledge or a lack of time and energy; many of these potentially eligible persons are already dealing with other complex and stressful situations, such as searching for employment and/or dealing with medical conditions. The purpose of this paper is to consider whether system-level reforms to B.C.’s income and social supports could make the system more consistent with BI principles (detailed below). This would be a first step toward a more complete contemplation of a BI. This paper focuses on reforms that would apply across the whole system.

Without taking issue with the revision itself, I point out that Howard, like many others, fails to defend UBI as non-exploitative. All his arguments fail to establish that the so-called ‘Surfer off Malibu’, a figure who is full-time dedicated to leisure, is not an exploiter in receiving UBI. The strategies to include him as a rightful recipient of a labor-free income rely on the (sometimes far-fetched) attribution of certain contingent features to him that would entitle him to compensation or reward, but that he might also not have. I argue that the best strategy for UBI-advocates is to admit that ‘slackers’ should be merely tolerated as non-deserving recipients, because the UBI-policy will otherwise have good effects.

This can in part be attributed to the fact that orthodox theory is effectively predicated upon describing the behavior of individuals whose level of affluence enables them to voluntarily withhold their labor from the market. Ironically, a means of resolution appears if we extend Gary Becker's utility producing model of the household to recognize two latent behavioral concerns: (1) the ‘need’ of households for money income in order to produce utility, and (2) the presence of work activity in the home. The resulting generalized labor supply model extends Becker's analysis to explicitly encompass both the behavior of the affluent, and the behavior of the poor who need to work in order to sustain their existence.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2009.10.011,Extracting a revised labor supply theory from Becker's model of the household,https://openalex.org/W2004694870

The decisive variable is the effect of labour automation, which increases economic insecurities globally, leaving some nation states in a position to cope with this and others not. The insecurities will increase migratory pressures on one hand but also justify the introduction of basic income on a nation state level on the other. The normative guideline is the republican conception of freedom as non-domination. This is used to justify a basic income, analyse how labour automation creates dominating structures and how borders dominate migrants seeking to move to countries which introduce a basic income. The result is that nation states that introduce a basic income to counter internal domination through labour automation, also have to look outside of their nation state. The imposition of borders in order to keep a basic income sustainable as well as labour automation itself, establish a form of domination over less developed countries and thus demand international regulation.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2020-0027,"Basic Income, Labour Automation and Migration – An Approach from a Republican Perspective",https://openalex.org/W3102209511

Any income-support program that corrects for money differences but not for time differences across households will discriminate against households with only one adult. Furthermore, such programs will provide financial incentives for households to form in certain ways. This paper sets up a two-dimensional poverty definition and then shows how this standard can be used to define voluntary versus involuntary poverty. Since the official poverty index was developed in the mid-1960s by the Social Security Administration (SSA) [7, 8], their categorization by income has been accepted as an equitable criterion with which to compare different types of households. As a result, policy-makers have thought that adjusting the benefit structure of an income-transfer program for money differentials across households corrected for the resource differences of these households. But households differ in their time resources as well as their money income. This paper argues that to base the benefit schedule of an income-support program on an index that defines poverty in terms of money income alone is to create gross inequities The author is Assistant Professor of Economics, University of California, Berkeley. * This paper benefited from comments made on an earlier draft by Barbara Bergmann, Nancy Chodorow, Frances Flanagan, Gillian Garcia, Aaron Gordon, Mel Jameson, Theodore Keeler, Harold Wilensky, Michael Wiseman, and Lloyd Ulman.

The equity problem, important in itself, takes on added significance when it creates incentives for individuals to adjust their living arrangements, and the problem becomes aggravated if the household structure appears to be in a transitional phase as in the 1970s. The impact of an income-maintenance scheme on the structure of households may prove to be more important over the long run than the program's influence on the labor supply, an issue that has captured the attention of economists and policy-makers. This paper attempts to shift the focus of attention by laying a foundation for analyzing the economic incentives for household formation implicit in proposed income-maintenance programs. First, a poverty standard in terms of both time and money inputs is defined. In this definition, the necessity of home production for the well-being of the household's members is emphasized. Then a measure of this generalized poverty standard is used to estimate the number of additional female-headed families who would be counted as poor because of a deficiency of nonmarket time. The policy implications of the new definition are explored by using the index to distinguish among the hard-core poor, the temporary poor, and the voluntary poor, and to estimate the potential poverty population. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy dilemmas posed by the potential interaction between benefit schedules and household composition.",https://doi.org/10.2307/145597,The Time-Poor: A New Look at Poverty,https://openalex.org/W108310728

A recent narrative, endorsed by prominent tech-billionaires, says we face mass unemployment, and we need a basic income. In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is an entirely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment, and it can be done again. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Taking lessons from history, it is clear that unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy.

A way to address this dilemma is to base policies and policy models on the principle notion that ‘work must pay’; in other words, income from employment should be higher than the social support of the unemployed. However, how accurately do these approaches and models represent the reality of benefit recipients, particularly in the context of increased employment precariousness? In this article, we use the cases of two disadvantaged regions in Czech Republic in order to contrast the presumptions of ‘making work pay’ policies with the everyday experience of welfare recipients. As we show, their situations are strongly shaped by current changes in the labour market, particularly the precarious character of accessible employment and high levels of indebtedness. The modelling of financial employment incentives and the public policies based on these calculations often do not correspond with the reality of welfare recipients that are often cycling in and out of precarious forms of employment. However, the authors’ main claim is that the very idea of the ‘work must pay’ approach focuses on the wrong question.

In the same year, the Castonguay-Nepveu Commission of Quebec suggested a similar scheme. In the early 1970s, a Social Security review reintroduced the concept. Based on proposals from these studies, the Canadian government, in partnership with the province of Manitoba, conducted a Negative Income Tax (NIT) Experiment called MINCOME, between 1974 and 1979. At the time, it was widely believed that this experiment would serve as a pilot for a universal programme that would revolutionize the ways in which Canadians pay taxes, receive benefits and earn income. The oil shocks and persistent stagflation of the 1970s brought different governments to power at both the federal and provincial levels, and ended MINCOME without implementation of the anticipated universal basic income proposal.

The latter permits us to identify potential general equilibrium repercussions through changes in wages and unemployment. The simulations indicate that the introduction of ALG II results in a negligible increase in employment of only 45 000 individuals.

Personal experiences of insecurity in the labour market are likely to affect how people view the desirability of basic income. According to the results, inadequate income increases the probability of supporting basic income. Opinions are also based on the two views of deservingness: individual blame (social problems are a result of individuals’ actions) or social blame (individual problems have social roots). Those who emphasise individual blame are sceptical about unconditional transfers, whereas the opposite is true with regard to social blame that is positively linked to the support for basic income. The two dimensions of deservingness are also strongly linked to individual political affiliation.

Evaluations of upstream cash transfer trials have failed to capture comprehensively the impacts that such systems might have on population health through inadequate design of the interventions themselves and failure to implement consistent, thorough research measures that can be used in microsimulations to model long-term impact. In this article, we describe the process of developing a generic, adaptive protocol resource to address this issue and the challenges involved in that process. The resource is designed for use in high-income countries (HIC) but draws on examples from a UK context to illustrate means of development and deployment. The resource is capable of further adaptation for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). It has particular application for trials of Universal Basic Income but can be adapted to those covering other kinds of cash transfer and welfare system changes.We outline two types of prospective intervention based on pilots and trials currently under discussion. In developing the remainder of the resource, we establish six key principles, implement a modular approach based on types of measure and their prospective resource intensity, and source (validated where possible) measures and baseline data primarily from routine collection and large, longitudinal cohort studies. Through these measures, we seek to cover all areas of health impact identified in our theoretical model for use in pilot and feasibility studies.We find that, in general, self-reported measures alongside routinely collected linked respondent data may provide a feasible means of producing data capable of demonstrating comprehensive health impact. However, we also suggest that, where possible, physiological measures should be included to elucidate underlying biological effects that may not be accurately captured through self-reporting alone and can enable modelling of long-term health outcomes. In addition, accurate self-reported objective income data remains a challenge and requires further development and testing. A process of development and implementation of the resource in pilot and feasibility studies will support assessment of whether or not our proposed health outcome measures are acceptable, feasible and can be used with validity and reliability in the target population.We suggest that while Open Access evaluation instruments are available and usable to measure most constructs of interest, there remain some areas for which further development is necessary.

While social investment – an influential policy paradigm at the level of the European Union – aims at promoting public services and maximum labour market participation, basic income is paid in cash and has sometimes been presented as the key component of a post-work future. In this article, we explore this apparent incongruence and show that these two visions for welfare reform are not necessarily incompatible. We argue that they may share a number of substantial points of agreement, and indeed may reinforce one another according to a logic of institutional complementarity. In particular, we claim that a partial basic income (i.e., a modest unconditional income guarantee, whose amount would be insufficient if one lives alone) could enhance or complement the key functions of a social-democratic version of the social investment strategy. By doing so, we conclude that the integration of a basic income into a social investment package could contribute to overcoming criticisms of the social investment agenda.

It can be defended from both a liberal-libertarian perspective as a replacement for existing benefits and social insurance (with Friedman often cited in this sense, although his negative tax proposal is fora family-based system; Capitalism and Freedom, p. 159),or from a progressive standpoint, in which case the basic income would be added to most existing benefits and social insurance. It is more in this second sense that the BIEN (2013) advocates a basic income, although the liberal aspect of the measure is also assumed: It's the most liberal solidarity principle one can get, as it ensures individual existence and social cohesion, without the rigidity of interventionism and no oppressing bureaucracy.

An increase in the share of the VS-type agents implies a degrowth transition to a lower level of average consumption. Analysis of the equilibrium framework shows that degrowth, whereby average market-based consumption falls, improves the equilibrium welfare, assuming the VS-type agents have sufficient resources, enabling a reduction in labour supplies. Sharing, collaborative consumption and basic income support welfare-increasing degrowth. Any growing economy can eventually reach the size at which degrowth would improve the welfare.

Basic income can play a crucial role in fostering such capacity. Because of its unconditionality, and thanks to bargaining power deriving from it, basic income is a sort of income that is convertible in terms of (a) time to conceive of (and put into practice) projects of one’s own, be it individually and/or collectively; (b) a capacity to explore alternative options and take promising risks; and (c) the right to credit, in the twofold sense of the right to financial resources and the right to social trust. As noticed and appreciated by some post-crash social movements, there are some spheres where such democracy-enhancing bargaining power may unfold: wage-earning work, the decommodification of labour force and the possible subsequent constitution of cooperatives and other self-managed (re)productive spaces, the household, entrepreneurship, socio-political participation, etc. In sum, more flexible combinations of different kinds of work may emerge when individuals and groups enjoy an income stream that is guaranteed as a right, which echoes both classical and contemporary discourses on the need for humans to have the democratic right to autonomously choose and determine work(s) all along the life cycle.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0007,Economic Sovereignty as the Democratization of Work: The Role of Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2463078194

In writing The Economics of Welfare, Pigou built a bridge between   old and   new economics at Cambridge and in Britain. Much of   book remains relevant for contemporary economics. The list of his analyses that continues to play an important role in economics is impressive. Some of   more important include: public goods and externalities, welfare criteria, index number problems, price discrimination,   theory of   firm,   structure of relief programs for   poor, and public finance.

As per analysis 98% of the world people concentrate only 2 % of the Global wealth, it is to eliminate poverty and bridge the gulf between the haves and have not’s. A Universal Basic Income is, like many rights, unconditional and universal: it entails that every citizen should have a right to a basic income to meet their needs by virtue of being citizens.     Methods : The study is centered on the concept of descriptive type. The concept of Universal Basic Income is not new. Of late, it is gaining currency among the Governments throughout the world in the light of growing disparities between the rich and the poor and it’s an endeavor on the part of the Governments to provide the poor safety nets. It is paid at regular intervals to the needy, may be monthly, to take out a decent living. Finland and Scotland pioneered UBI. But, Finland abandoned the programme because of lack of funds.     Findings : Universal Basic Income gained prominence in India with “Garibo Hatao” slogan given by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Like in other countries, itis aimed at providing every Indian living Below Poverty Line (BPL) with a minimum income. A fixed amount would be transferred to the account of the beneficiary in the country. There are some conceptual arguments against providing Universal Basic Income. Primary being, it induces laziness and reduces the incentive to work among the people. Should income be detached from employment? Itis a concern out of reciprocity. The Economic survey 2016-17 had estimated UBI’s cost at 4.9% of GDP. This is against 5.2 % GDP spent on all 950 central sector and centrally sub-sponsored schemes.     Application:   All the political parties support this type of schemes to reduce the income inequalities between the rich and the poor. Infact, it is a mesmerizing scheme to lure common people to garner votes.

We develop a model with an increasingly right-skewed distribution of skill across households and a gender wage gap within households. Household preference for basic income decreases as skill level increases and female labour supply decreases with time spent rearing children. Majority voting supports the basic income scheme as mean relative to median household skill increases. Household fertility and skill level are inversely related under the scheme. An increase in the marginal tax rate to fund required government revenue could excacerbate gender inequality by reducing female labour supply. Quantitative illustrations suggest that the recent peak in the mean to median wage gap would provide voting support for basic income from the majority of households in the United States.

4.291144,4.36817,1,"Background: In the context of the UK Government’s ‘prevention agenda’, Laura Webber and colleagues have called for a ‘health in all policies’ approach. Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a system of cash transfers to citizens. Recent research suggests it could significantly benefit population health, including via reducing stress. However, a Finnish trial of a policy with similarities to UBI has influenced debate. This was reported as a failure due to a policy objective of reducing unemployment, despite demonstrating significant benefits to well-being. Aims and objectives: In this piece, we seek to advance the debate about the cost-benefit of UBI by identifying knowledge gaps and proposing a means of designing effective trials. Methods: We review UBI trial design and findings in comparison with social gradient in health literature and biopsychosocial theory to identify knowledge gaps. Findings: We highlight a need to refocus UBI trials on improved health, including via reduced stress, to provide policy makers the means of producing accurate cost-benefit analysis. Previous trials have either not reflected likely UBI policy or failed to measure impacts that enable accurate analysis. We contend that interdisciplinary work is required to establish trials that observe factors known to drive the social health gradient. Finally, we argue that statistical modelling is needed to extrapolate shorter-term findings to long-term population-level outcomes. Discussion and conclusions: Resource allocation by Government and/or major funders is required to produce evidence that enables accurate analysis of UBI. Such trials would provide a platform for interdisciplinary work resulting in joined-up evidence and policy.",https://doi.org/10.1332/174426420x15820274674068,Measuring the health impact of Universal Basic Income as an upstream intervention: holistic trial design that captures stress reduction is essential,https://openalex.org/W3012472904

It does so against a backdrop of global uncertainty and ongoing challenges to the current economic landscape. The model investigated is known as universal basic income (UBI) which provides a minimum payment to all citizens of a jurisdiction. In doing so it decouples income from labour and removes any means or employment tests from the receipt of assistance. To adequately address this model, a theoretical rationale for such an approach is first discussed followed by an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages.

24.846497,-7.7093987,5,"Contemporary egalitarianism has largely developed in abstraction from the basic fact that time passes, people age, and so any given society comprises several overlapping generations. As a result, few normative tools are available to assess claims made about the fairness of time-sensitive distributions. The field of intergenerational justice has emerged to fill this gap, but its theorists have primarily focused on the question of what we owe to future generations. My thesis contributes to egalitarian thought and intergenerational justice by providing an egalitarian account of justice between co-existing generations. It answers the question of which inequalities between age groups, on the one hand, and birth cohorts, on the other hand, matter; and it offers a framework to establish what counts as a suitably egalitarian treatment of young people.
The thesis is in two parts: the first establishes the theoretical framework, and the second makes explicit its implications for two policy discussions. In Part I, I highlight the generational implications of the dominant diachronic view of equality through time – complete lives egalitarianism (CLE). While it provides key insights into birth-cohort justice, CLE cannot account for why some cases of age-group inequalities are unjust. I then propose two complements to CLE to overcome its limitations: a prudential diachronic approach grounded on Daniels’s theory of age-group justice, and a synchronic alternative inspired by McKerlie’s work. From the first three chapters, I derive three principles of equality between overlapping generations: (1) approximate cohort equality, (2) prudential lifespan planning (lifespan sufficiency and efficiency), and (3) relational synchronic equality. I then draw on these principles to establish what ‘treating the young as equals’ means. In Part II, I put forward an intergenerational egalitarian case for basic income. I then consider whether we should be concerned about the absence of young people in parliaments, and propose the introduction of youth quotas.",,Treating Young People As Equals: Intergenerational Justice in Theory and Practice,https://openalex.org/W1490165506
18.048054,19.522348,5,"The idea of universal basic income is recieving increasing attention in the political, media and public agendas. This policy proposal constitutes a radical departure from the orthodox welfare rationale of giving to those in need, or attaching conditions to welfare support. Given the permutation that a UBI presents, many pilot projects and field experiments are being carried out globally to test the effects of this novel policy idea. Key questions arise from these developments: are the lessons learned from these experiments being fed back into the policy process? Are the pilot project results guiding and informing policymakers? Overall, can we observe any political effects of such scientific efforts? I address these questions through a qualitative case study analysis of the B-Mincome project. Through an in-depth analysis of this pilot, some of the key factors influencing the (limited) policy and political effects of the pilot project have been identified. The B-Mincome case study shows that the barriers to policy change were in place well before the pilot, and evidently, remained unaltered by it. The political landscape in Barcelona's City Council, its economic powers and institutional context were unchanged by the pilot, and in fact shaped the pilot design, moving it away from the UBI proposal. The B-Mincome experience illustrates the need to accommodate the pilot design to the politics and economics of the experiment, and shows the unintended consequences that such an adaptation of the pilot design may have in relation to its original objectives. In the case of Barcelona, this has meant a move away from a UBI-style pilot design, resulting in very limited effects on the debate or policy design of cash transfers, having a greater policy impact on active polices instead. However, by taking a broader look at Spanish and Catalan politics, our analysis has shown that unexpected factors may end up triggering a debate much more effectively than a pilot project.",https://doi.org/10.1177/13882627221123347,The policy and political consequences of the B-Mincome pilot project,https://openalex.org/W4296381518

He advocated prioritising the universality and individuality of a citizen's income but replacing its unconditionality with a ‘participation’ requirement. At the time, Atkinson's critique read as political realism: to eliminate means‐testing, make a concession to the fear of free‐riding. Ironically, Atkinson remained opposed to unconditionality despite his own critical contributions to documenting the growing income and wealth inequality that have increased support for an unconditional basic income. In this article I consider the ‘participation’ requirement from a gender perspective in order to uncover the problematic notions of ‘dependence’, ‘independence’, reciprocity, and free‐riding that underlie normative arguments for conditional over unconditional benefits. Employing such a perspective demonstrates the superiority of unconditional benefits in achieving more efficient and effective income support and reducing inequality—Atkinson's core commitments throughout his distinguished career.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-923x.12518,"Work, Leisure, and Care: A Gender Perspective on the Participation Income",https://openalex.org/W2804518254

6.2126255,6.7069936,5,"Unconditional basic income (UBI) is one of the most discussed policy options for a degrowth transition. Advocates highlight UBI's theoretical potential to reduce unnecessary material consumption, alleviate poverty and redistribute social wealth, achieve wellbeing within ecological limits, shift activity from wage-labour to meaningful work, and facilitate increased social participation. However, UBI's radical potential remains under-examined within the empirical research, which focuses more on the policy's potential to increase the supply of wage-labour and stimulate economic growth. This paper aims to push back against this limiting trend. It begins by outlining some of the characteristics of more sustainable and just societies, based on post-growth perspectives, and outlines the arguments put forward to support UBI's compatibility with a degrowth transition. It then demonstrates that, despite support from UBI and many post-growth scholars, such arguments are not mainstreamed in the contemporary empirical UBI research. The paper argues that this increases the risk of UBI being captured by capitalist interests. To avoid this outcome, the paper proposes an alternative research agenda to help assess and advance UBI's radical potential in line with post-growth visions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2024.103375,Unconditional Basic Income and a Degrowth Transition: Adding Empirical Rigour to Radical Visions,https://openalex.org/W4393321426

30.046776,3.750583,2,"Regarding the prospects of a transformation of income-security programmes into a universal and unconditional minimum income scheme, Belgium and the Netherlands are of particular interest. Since the early 1980s, one can find in the ‘low countries’ some of the most prominent proponents of a basic income (BI), i.e. “an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement” (Van Parijs 2000). In no other advanced welfare state the BI debate has been so broad and lively than in the Netherlands. Since 1975, the idea of a basisinkomen has been discussed within many Dutch political parties, trade unions, social organisations, and even at the governmental level. It was at the core of various official reports that progressively increased its respectability in political circles. Belgian political actors have always been more reluctant to it, with the noteworthy exception of the two green parties. But the academic discussion has been quite extensive. The founding congress and second international conference of the Basic Income European Network (BIEN) were held in Belgium, respectively in 1986 and 1988. In 1999, a Belgian political formation named ‘Vivant’ was launched as the first European single-issue party entirely focused on BI. Although it remains a tiny player in Belgium’s political game, it managed to attract public attention on the proposal through eye-catching posters in the country’s main cities. In this chapter, I will scrutinise the political chances of BI in the low countries and the probability of incremental steps into that direction. In the Section 1, assuming that a BI would replace most existing means-tested minimum income schemes, I will briefly review the main social assistance programmes of both countries. I shall try to demonstrate that a paradigm shift is underway which may at first sight seriously undermine the progress to a more universal and unconditional income-security system. In fact, as it is the case of many other European countries, Belgium and the Netherlands are in the process of restructuring their welfare states along ‘activation’ lines. Even if effective retrenchment remained limited to date, work requirements have been more strictly enforced with the passing years. Partly based on interviews and an extensive review of the press, Section 2 will be devoted to an account of more than twenty-five years of BI debate in both countries. The Dutch discussion already started in the mid-1970s, whereas the idea only appeared in 1985 in Belgium’s public debate. Even if the Dutch BI proponents were politically more powerful, in both countries the numerous BI advocates always failed to gain longlasting political support for their proposal. But in addressing questions of universality and conditionality, they managed to have an influence on the terms of the welfare reform discussions. Section 3 of this chapter will then focus on the very reasons of this failure to gain political support, which are of paramount importance for the future prospects of unconditional minimum income schemes. Starting from the hypothesis that under certain conditions a BI would be economically sustainable, most participants in the debate stress that four important obstacles have been in the way of the proposal. As is argued in some detail, the moral objection to an income by right without a related duty to work seems to be the most decisive impediment.

-20.491638,-0.8542829,5,"Democratic Distributive Justice by Ross Zucker In Democratic Distributive Justice, Ross Zucker (2000)1 argues that a capitalist economic system constitutes a community of agents with certain common aims; that the individuals who comprise this community contribute through their interdependent activity to the promotion of those shared aims; and that the intrinsically interdependent character of most economic activity establishes a principle of distributive justice which entitles every participant in the economy to an equal share of a part of the income and wealth created by that activity. According to Zucker, the principal common aim of all agents is the preservation and expansion of capital; for all income originates in an expanding circuit of money and production. Interruption of that circuit damages workers and capitalists, consumers and sellers, alike. The perpetuation of this circuit depends in large part on socially organic activities. First, production is by its nature collaborative and grounded in intersectoral linkages. Second, no production process can continue unless there are buyers for what that process creates. Third, consumption patterns are themselves socially formed. And, fourth, so are the work habits upon which efficient production depends. The social character of the circuit of capital, Zucker contends, justifies egalitarianism in the distribution of part of the aggregate income. His argument can be read as an answer to Margaret Thatcher's famous remark, in a 1987 interview, that ""there is no such thing as society. There are [only] individual[s] . . . and . . . families."" Zucker's argument is novel and carefully developed. It is also extremely topical. Over the past two decades income and wealth inequality in the US have gone through the roof (see Bernstein, Mishel & Brocht, 2000). A similar, though less pronounced, trend is evident in Western Europe, where economic policy discussions center on whether, or how quickly, the allegedly more efficient American model should be imported. The same issues have arisen in connection with the transition to capitalism of the economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Recent financial scandals in the US have cast a discomfiting light on the ethical ramifications of exploding inequality, and some observers have begun to worry that the re-emergence of Gilded Age disparities in economic well-being will have profoundly destabilizing social consequences (see Krugman, 2002). Economists are notoriously self-conscious about the scientific pedigree of their discipline. Most of us would rather talk about efficiency than about justice, and questions of distributive justice concern precisely the sort of normative issues that economists prefer to avoid. The conventional neo-liberal wisdom maintains that there is a trade-off between efficiency and equality—that the latter can be enhanced only at the expense of the former. But this view is a distortion of the orthodox neoclassical position, which is agnostic on the desirability of alternative distributive regimes. Indeed the reluctance of orthodox economics to engage the problem of distributive justice is reflected in the ultimately vacuous criterion by which it evaluates economic outcomes—Pareto optimality. A particular allocation of resources is said to be Pareto optimal if no agent's well-being can be improved without reducing the well-being of some other agent. Leaving aside the fact that the conditions required to generate Pareto optimal outcomes are so restrictive that they can never obtain in actual market economies, the Pareto criterion is an extremely weak prescriptive device. It says only what is obvious: that if resources can be reallocated so as to make someone better off without causing harm to anyone else, such a reallocation is desirable. The criterion does not even allow us to say that a Pareto optimal allocation is always superior to a position that is not Pareto optimal.2 It dodges entirely the problem of how we ought to proceed when the well-being of some agents can be improved only at the cost of diminishing the well-being of others, that is, the problem of redistribution. Neoclassical theory does contend that market outcomes are by-and-large efficient (pace the standard caveats about...",https://doi.org/10.1353/gso.2004.0030,Distributive Justice: An Economist's Perspective,https://openalex.org/W2040554685

These new imaginaries include radically expanded forms of redistribution, such as unconditional cash transfers or universal basic income. But what are the views of the ‘surplus populations’ themselves? This article uses ethnographic research in an informal settlement in South Africa to understand why the unemployed or precariously employed poor are themselves often reluctant to delink labour and income. In particular, we focus on the discursive use of ‘laziness’ by urban unemployed young men. The varied (and often contradictory) ways in which these men employ the laziness discourse sheds light on the logics linking waged work and money in our informants’ social imaginaries. It illuminates the underlying contradictions and complexities of such logics, including those of gender, relational obligations, expectations of citizenship, and the inevitable tensions between aspirational hopes and economic realities. To begin thinking ‘beyond the proper job’, to use Ferguson and Li's phrase, we must unravel and understand such nuanced logics that continue to bind together hard work, deservingness and cash – even for those left out of labour markets.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0001972019001037,"Labour, laziness and distribution: work imaginaries among the South African unemployed",https://openalex.org/W3012275036

This study shifts its focus towards an alternative minimum-security model, the Safety Income (SI) Model, representing a nuanced departure from both established policies and UBI. SI is a welfare system that supplements households earning below the standard median income with 50 percent of the difference between the standard median and their current earnings. The study presents the set-up of SI and assesses the cost of its implementation in South Korea. Employing a computable general equilibrium model, the study analyze the impacts of SI, UBI, and the existing scheme in South Korea on income disparities, labor market outcomes, and Gross Domestic Product.

The reform is undertaken in a life-cycle economy with individual heterogeneity and uninsurable idiosyncratic labor risk. The optimal NIT consists of a 22% rate and a transfer equivalent to 11% of per-capita GDP. The ex-ante average welfare gain is a 2.1% annual increase of individual consumption. I show that a NIT outperforms a flat tax reform (income tax plus deduction) by a considerable margin. The key consequence of the reform is that high-productivity agents increase their relative importance in the labor supply at the expense of low-productivity agents.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2016.04.008,NIT picking: The macroeconomic effects of a Negative Income Tax,https://openalex.org/W3121783149

Two different ways of employing the term ‘adequacy’ are discussed: (1) A Basic Income might be described as adequate if the Basic Income itself was enough to live on (somehow defined); and (2) A Basic Income scheme might be described as adequate if every household had a net income—made up from individuals’ Basic Incomes and other sources of income—that was sufficient to live on (somehow defined). Examples are given of both approaches. ‘Sufficient to live on’ is then defined in terms of Minimum Income Standards, and it is shown that a Basic Income set at Minimum Income Standard levels would be infeasible in a number of respects, but that a Basic Income scheme that required that household net incomes should reach Minimum Income Standard levels could be more feasible.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14248-2_11,Minimum Income Standards in the Basic Income Debate,https://openalex.org/W4312597061

This conception of social justice combines freedom, equality, and efficiency.

Is such an unconditional basic income not a recipe for exploitation of the hard workers by the lazy? Not in any sense that makes exploitation intrinsically unjust. Can a higher unconditional basic income be sustainably achieved under capitalism than under socialism? There are empirical and theoretical reasons to think so.

Seldom have trials of UBI been designed adequately to measure its impact on the health of participants across the spectrum of socioeconomic status. But the data that does exist suggests that policy has the potential to improve this aspect of people’s lives. Two theoretical frames have been advanced to explain this effect. The first is based, broadly, on its impact on behaviour, highlighting the ways in which present socio-economic conditions, including needs and means-based welfare systems, disincentivise healthy choices and activity. The second is based, broadly, on its impact on the endocrine system, holding that UBI serves to protect individuals from a range of stress-related illnesses induced by socio-economic conditions associated with hierarchy and inequality. While the absence of epidemiological input into designing trials means that these frames have yet to be tested, there are good sources of data from non-UBI-related studies that support their validity. This account lays out pathways to impact, demonstrates important points of consideration in the designing of trials and argues strongly for a trial on the basis of a transformative ‘upstream intervention’ capable of shaping the way that we deal with health. In that respect, we argue that, seven decades on from the creation of the NHS, UBI can be Labour’s next great and common-sense contribution to Britain’s health.",,The Health Case for Universal Basic Income:Supporting Document for The Labour Party’s Report on Universal Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2922941539

-38.82395,-18.523043,1,"We examine the influence of individual characteristics and targeted and universal social policy on single-mother poverty with a multilevel analysis across 18 affluent Western democracies. Although single mothers are disproportionately poor in all countries, there is even more cross-national variation in single-mother poverty than in poverty among the overall population. By far, the United States has the highest rate of poverty among single mothers among affluent democracies. The analyses show that single-mother poverty is a function of the household's employment, education, and age composition, and the presence of other adults in the household. Beyond individual characteristics, social policy exerts substantial influence on single-mother poverty. We find that two measures of universal social policy significantly reduce single-mother poverty. However, one measure of targeted social policy does not have significant effects, and another measure is significantly negative only when controlling for universal social policy. Moreover, the effects of universal social policy are larger. Additional analyses show that universal social policy does not have counterproductive consequences in terms of family structure or employment, while the results are less clear for targeted social policy. Although debates often focus on altering the behavior or characteristics of single mothers, welfare universalism could be an even more effective anti-poverty strategy.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0094-z,"Targeting, Universalism, and Single-Mother Poverty: A Multilevel Analysis Across 18 Affluent Democracies",https://openalex.org/W2108397001

Various forms of a guaranteed income, including concepts of an unconditional basic income and a negative income tax, were discussed by intellectuals, economists, and civil rights advocates. After 1969, the Nixon administration considered introducing a negative income tax as an income floor for two-parent families without a means test or work requirements. At the time, such a radical policy was discussed in an open debate that may seem surprising today. While libertarian conservatives appreciated the proposal’s efficiency and restraining effect on government, progressives cherished the prospect of alleviating poverty. The problem was that Nixon, seeking to sell his policy to limited constituencies, denied or ignored his own proposal’s progressive core and instead advanced a racialized perception of welfare policy.

There is evidence to suggest that schooling is causally related to improvements in health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that raising the incomes of the poor leads to improvement in their health outcomes.

They are so to say mathematically uniform systems. If we try to implement these schedules on an existing system of social transfers and taxes, the results may nevertheless be different. One problem is that taxes are generally calculated on yearly basis but social transfers are paid on monthly or even daily basis. There can be also other differences in the implementation. In this paper a simulation experiment with the Finnish tax and transfer system is presented. Two levels of basic income are defined: a normal basic income for adults over 18 years and a bit higher basic income (basic pension) for pensioners. Two alternative simulations are made: one corresponding to an unconditional basic income model and the other corresponding to the idea of negative income tax.

It proposes three main arguments. First, classical liberals view the purpose of government to be the reduction of coercion, both public and private. Second, a proper understanding of the nature of coercion indicates that parties subject to certain types of hardship are being coerced. Third, where the total amount of coercion is reduced by eliminating the hardship, the classical liberal state must do so as to fulfill its purpose. Hence, this article argues that if the total amount of coercion in society can be reduced by the state employing the amount of coercion necessary to maintain an unconditional basic income guarantee, then the classical liberal state is obligated to maintain such a guarantee by its underlying justification.",https://doi.org/10.1017/beq.2017.12,No Malibu Surfer Left Behind: Three Tales About Market Coercion,https://openalex.org/W2605695204

The present proposal, radical as it may seem to some, is accordingly offered as worthy of consideration. The main section of this article is on a proposed scheme, named Asset and Income Limits, for instituting maxima to the legitimate incomes and assets of individuals. This scheme involves every individual being associated with two bank accounts, an asset account (their own property) and a holding account (held in escrow). Other parts of the advocated change in economic landscape are a radically different understanding of the concept of work and the introduction of a basic income. The roles of technology and culture, in creating both the opportunities and the obstacles to a transformation of society, are discussed. Non-monetary, non-convertible rewards for exceptional contributions to society are described. The scheme enhances freedom, being neutral in relation to many other value systems, such as the secular/sacred spectrum. The qualitative versus quantitative dichotomy is addressed, and it is concluded that the most that can be said of a just and sustainable society that has yet to be created is that the maximum income should be no more than one order of magnitude greater than the basic income, that is ~10 times at the most.

31.17965,32.56154,2,"This paper argues that a guaranteed income is not only consistent with the principle of reciprocity but is required for reciprocity. This conclusion follows from a three-part argument. First, if a guaranteed income is in place, all individuals have the same opportunity to live without working. Therefore, those who choose not to work do not take advantage of a privilege that is unavailable to everyone else. Second, in the absence of an unconditional income, society is, in effect, applying the principle, (S)he who does not work, will not eat. If the application of this principle is to be consistent with reciprocity, it must be applied to everyone. Most modern industrial societies exempt many citizens from that choice. For example, the owners of external assets do not face the work-or-starve choice and do take advantage of a privilege that is not available to others. An unconditional guaranteed income is one way to eliminate that violation of reciprocity. Third, this paper addresses the criticism that the guaranteed income exploits middle-class workers by demonstrating that a basic income will have a positive effect on wages, which will at least partially counteract the effect of the taxes needed to pay for it.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329299027003004,Reciprocity and the Guaranteed Income,https://openalex.org/W2163944971

We find that the intervention led to growth in care work activities and education, especially among women, moderate growth in self-employment, relatively strong growth in the portion of men and women simply reporting that they did not want to work, and the strongest growth in nonemployment connected to dissatisfaction with work/job conditions.

The work reveals the relevance of UBI concept development in the context of the need to overcome mass poverty in Russia. The result of the theoretical analysis shows that generally recognized UBI principles (universality, unconditionality, individual nature of monetary payments, their regularity) are justified by long-term trends in social policy evolution. The prospect of introducing universal basic income is presented as a qualitative transition (leap) in implementation of the latter. The social policy measures, closest to implementation of UBI principles, are characterized as its transitional forms including experiments on its introduction. To assess the practical feasibility of UBI transitional forms, the article uses the results of a survey of experts from different Russian regions conducted with the authors' participation and a pilot experiment and modeling of the results of UBI toolkit implementation. The paper proposes a possible scheme for implementing UBI tools in Russia, as well as pilot projects for low-income families with children, graduates of universities and secondary vocational educational institutions during the transition from study to the first place of work, the unstable employed (including the unemployed).

Results illustrate the challenges, but also the strengths, of existing social protection systems. A BI would fix benefit coverage gaps that exist in many countries, but would require very substantial tax rises if it were to be set at a meaningful level.

Unconditional redistributive schemes do not take formal precautions to deal with potential motivational problems that may affect their stability. For example, they are designed to give people the freedom to decide whether or not to participate in the job market. However, scholars like Philippe Van Parijs and Simon Birnbaum think that the promotion of an ethos of justice can potentially do the necessary motivational work to secure the stability of unconditional redistributive institutions. Their solution lies in changing people’s behavior through an informal motivational mechanism rather than through a formal rule or institution. This paper argues against that ‘ethos-based solution.’ It presents three reasons to distrust that solution. First, it argues that even broader and more inclusive ethoi of justice can become oppressive and violate people’s freedom. Second, it suggests that the formal and informal strategies to generate that ethos may be difficult to implement, monitor, and control.

However, similar views are also expressed in many other justifications of basic income that stress the strategic importance of exit-based empowerment. This article argues that the reliance of these theories on concepts and assumptions of libertarianism makes them ill-equipped to justify core requirements of social empowerment, and to identify the forms of agency needed to sustainably advance the radical objectives they favour.

Taking social support measures requires the addressed use of budgetary funds and strengthening it.

The system of threshold criteria developed with the use of social standards of consumption and taking into account the effect of savings on consumption in cohabitation, formed the criterion basis for ensuring and strengthening addressed social supporting indigent families with children. The following tools were used at different stages of the Project implementation: the subsistence minimum of the main socio-demographic groups of the population, the equivalence scale, the equivalent differentiated subsistence minimum of families with children with the effect of saving on consumption and its components, a guaranteed minimum income.Scientifically grounded threshold levels are an important component of the mechanism for improving the economic situation of indigent families with children up to the level of the guaranteed minimum income, providing with the resources potential of the region and taking into account the assessment of the underutilized economic potential of these families and the conditions for their more active gaining additional income from employment.Receiving practical approval of the tools developed during the Project has demonstrated their effectiveness in strengthening the social support for indigent families with children",https://doi.org/10.19181/1999-9836-2019-10049,Methodological Approaches to Strengthening Addressed Social Supporting Indigent Families with Children,https://openalex.org/W3202511469

The demogrant has received surprisingly little scholarly attention, but this article locates it in Buchanan’s broader constitutional political economy project and shows it was a logical application of his theoretical framework to the problem of inefficient and unfair welfare systems when reform to the basic institutions of majoritarian democracy was not forthcoming. The demogrant aims to end the problems of majority cycling and rent seeking that plague contemporary welfare states and therefore offers a model of welfare without rent seeking—a constitutional welfare state.

16.25269,6.830176,2,"Unconditional basic income (BI) is a proposal to reform social welfare
provision under which every member of society would be entitled to an income above subsistence level without means test or work requirement. The advantages of BI are that it effectively reduces poverty and increases the real freedom of citizens. However, by abolishing the necessity to work on the individual level BI policies are also inherently risky since they fundamentally change incentive structures. It is clearly possible that BI is fiscally infeasible in this sense that not enough people would engage in productive efforts on the basis of which a BI could then be distributed. Social science is to date unable to say how likely an outcome this is. From the perspective of BI supporters this state of affairs is suboptimal since the burden of proof on the feasibility of BI is widely perceived to fall on them. Basic income social experiments (BISE) are a very useful tool for meeting this strategic challenge. This is, firstly, because they are the best available method for generating knowledge on the consequences of a radically new programme such as BI. However, despite all methodological sophistication the social sciences can reduce but never eliminate the uncertainty regarding the consequences of BI, including fiscal feasibility. Secondly, BISE are useful because they help to overcome the discursive impasse which results from the fundamental lack of knowledge. BISE would help to move the currently stuck debate and – most importantly – show great promise for shifting the burden of proof back to the defendants of the status quo. Lastly, this paper finds ethical objections to BISE to be insubstantial and ascertains the feasibility of BISE in the German context. It hence concludes that proponents of basic income should advocate basic income social experiments in Germany.",,Should Proponents of Basic Income Advocate Basic Income Social Experiments in Germany,https://openalex.org/W2186384275

The concept of social mechanism is used to illustrate how social practices can simultaneously reinforce and challenge the dominant (food) regime. We argue that current discussions on degrowth fail to envision how such contrasting developments are linked, and that the degrowth paradox originates in the idea of capitalism and the steady-state economy as alternative systems.

However, experiencing disadvantage might also reduce faith in government’s ability to make things better, indirectly reducing support for redistributive action, and leading to a spiral of widening disadvantage and increasing political disengagement. Indeed, disadvantaged communities sometimes favour right-wing platforms over those offering redistribution, as in the taking of ‘red wall’ constituencies in the North and Midlands of England by the UK Conservative party in 2019. This article uses quantitative data from a survey of ‘red wall’ voters (n = 805) to examine the bases of people’s perceptions of redistributive policies. We find that even a radical redistributive policy, Universal Basic Income (UBI), receives consistently high levels of support (69.45 SD 27.24). Lower socioeconomic status, greater financial distress and greater risk of destitution all increase support. These effects are partly mediated by mental distress, which is markedly higher among the less well off. However, the same socioeconomic factors also reduce faith in government, which in turn is associated with lower support. Thus, those who stand to benefit most from redistribution are aware of their material interests, but are also the least confident in the ability of government to improve their lives. As such, there is a clear political challenge for progressive politicians: those whose support they depend upon require a significant redistributive offer, but also need to be persuaded of the viability of reform to support progressive change.",https://doi.org/10.1177/13691481221146886,"Can the ‘downward spiral’ of material conditions, mental health and faith in government be stopped?

The workfare concept lies behind the public work programmes. There are serious professional debates whether public work can primarily be seen as a ’compulsion and work test’ or, rather, as an opportunity of entering the primary labour market. The available efficiency analyses unanimously state that public work forms have the biggest role in testing willingness to work and the obligatory nature is the strongest of all active labour market policies. Research also indicates that public work reintegrates only few people back to the primary labour market and the majority are restrained from seeking a job and other income generating activities.

It notes the potential for a portfolio of specialized computer algorithms to compete with human general intelligence in work. The analysis contributes to the debate between economists dubious about claims that AI robotics will disrupt work and futurists who expect many jobs to be fully automated in coming years. It advances three “laws of robo-economics” to guide thinking about the new technologies and presents evidence that growing robot intensity has begun to impact the job market.

If implemented correctly, UBI can add a powerful tool to the Federal Reserve toolkit. UBI can be used to reintroduce inflation to the countries which suffer long-lasting deflationary environment.

The liberties in question are social liberty (freedom from forceful interference, basic rights), and the possibilities offered by domains of choice which can provide equal liberty while being different for individuals with different productivities.The method is deductive from the basic relevant concepts.The result is that this distribution consists of an equal sharing of the proceeds of the same labour for all individuals (with their different productivities). The individuals choose freely their total labour (with no other tax). This redistributive structure is Equal-Labour Income Equalization or ELIE. It also has a number of other important meanings, such as: general balanced labour reciprocity (each yields to each other the proceeds of the same labour); equal basic universal income financed by an equal labour of all; and uniform linear concentration to the mean of the distribution of total incomes (including the value of leisure).This result extends to multidimensional labour (duration, education, intensity, etc.), and to partial labour including unemployments.The practical application relies on exemption of overtime labour from the income tax, and a tax credit.

Reed explains how microsimulation modelling works by combining household survey data on incomes and characteristics across the population with information about how the tax and benefits system operates and about how the Basic Income scheme would operate. A worked example is offered. Torry then contributes a detailed analysis of another illustrative Basic Income scheme that retains and recalculates means-tested benefits.

The modern practice of social protection of the population in Russia is characterized by increased efforts to find and implement new mechanisms that ensure an increase in the level of social protection of citizens in a situation of permanent socio-economic instability. The above explains the relevance of studying the mechanism of unconditional basic income as one of the social protection tools, including by conducting empirical research among various categories of subjects of the sphere of social protection, who can assess the possibilities and problems of implementing the mechanism in question. The survey of specialists and heads of social protection management bodies in the Irkutsk Region and the Republic of Buryatia was conducted by the authors in 2021–2022 using a semi-structured interview of 32 respondents. According to the number of informants and the content of the questions, the study can be described as intelligence. The purpose of the study was to assess the awareness of specialists about the content of the mechanism of unconditional basic income and to identify their opinions about the possibilities and problems of introducing this social protection tool into Russian practice. The study revealed a low level of awareness of the interviewed specialists about the problems of unconditional basic income, while their professional experience in the field of social protection allowed us to assess the range of problems associated with the possible use of this tool. Among the main problems of its implementation, respondents attributed the lack of financial resources from the state in order to ensure the payment of unconditional basic income, as well as significant difficulties in the administration of this social protection tool. Among the most significant possible consequences of the introduction of an unconditional basic income were a decrease in the activity of the population in the field of employment and an increase in manifestations of social dependency.

As Jacques Ranciere mentions, this is a condition of the current “post-political” time. In this context, UBI has appeared as a means to regain the political signification of individual attending to their material necessities and looking forward to avoiding an increasing level of precarity. However, UBI poses some processual and intrinsic problematizations affecting its emancipatory character resulting in exclusionary social, economic and political attitudes. Thus, this article will analyze the role of UBI in recovering the categories of citizen and democracy and the main problems its implementation would face. This research wants to show that, paradoxically, UBI can provide a substantial improvement for those social groups in risk of exclusion such as immigrants, women or precarious workers.

The Australian tax–transfer system is already very complicated and the aims of the EITC—notably reductions in effective tax rates for low income earners—might be achievable through reforms to existing components of the system. Such tax rates can be lowered either through reductions in social security tapers, or reductions in income tax payable. Action to reduce tapers affecting families is already proceeding through the social security component of the Government's tax reform package. To go further, by reducing tapers on the main allowances, like Newstart Allowance and Parenting Payment, would accelerate developments for such allowances to become forms of wage supplementation for the low paid. If it were not desired to go further down this path (and it does have problems), then relief of income tax burdens could be implemented through changes to the rate structure.

One overlooked mechanism of particular importance to health researchers is the possibility that guaranteed income might increase consultation of primary and preventive care (e.g., annual doctors’ visits; regular vaccination against infectious disease) by providing people with both the time and monetary resources to do so, thereby improving general health. We remedy this shortcoming by studying the effects of an exogenous shock to Alaska’s UBI payments to all state residents: the decision in 2022 to render the dividend’s “energy relief” provisions as non-taxable (thereby increasing payments by approximately $2,000 inflation-adjusted dollars). Quasi-experimental random effects regression modeling procedures suggest that the number of Alaskans who sought primary care post-reform (relative to beforehand) increased by 6pp, which was significantly greater than the same difference (2pp) observed across all other (non-UBI) US States (∆ = 4pp, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Relatedly, we detect suggestive evidence that comparatively fewer Alaskans had difficulty affording primary care during this period, although we find less consistent evidence that increased UBI payments increased flu vaccine uptake rates relative to the national average.

We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.12.005,Understanding and misunderstanding randomized controlled trials,https://openalex.org/W2515189678

-13.025674,-51.69768,0,"This paper examines the link between political support for basic income funded by linear income taxation and income inequality by household and gender. We develop a model with an increasingly right-skewed distribution of skill across households and a gender wage gap within households. Household preference for basic income decreases as skill level increases and female labour supply decreases with time spent rearing children. Majority voting supports the basic income scheme as mean relative to median household skill increases. Household fertility and skill level are inversely related under the scheme.

Quantitative illustrations suggest that the recent peak in the mean to median wage gap would provide voting support for basic income from the majority of households in the United States.

Conceptually, it draws a distinction between ‘practical support’ and ‘principled support’, with the first referring to support based on arguments about the predicted outcomes of basic income (such as its effects on poverty, income inequality and labour supply), and the second involving support based on arguments related to the assumed normative virtues or vices of basic income (such as its capacity to ensure real freedom for all or its vulnerability to promote laziness). Empirically, the chapter uses data from three different types of data sources–traditional opinion polls, survey experiments and qualitative research–to reveal which types of arguments are most prevalently used, by whom, and in which contexts.

It follows, therefore, that the labor-supply response of the family as a whole, as well as the labor-supply response of individual family members, should be a focus of analysis. Recent theoretical literature in economics has emphasized the simultaneity of family decisions about work effort. Secondary workers are likely to make decisions about their level of work effort in light of the earnings opportunities of the primary earner, and vice versa. And this interdependence of work decisions is likely to be reinforced by the rules of income maintenance programs like those tested in the experiment.l Thus, this article is concerned with family labor-supply response.2 The obvious measure to use in such analysis is earnings. An earnings measure gives a straightforward way of weighting the importance of individual family members to get the total family response. It also provides the most direct translation of the family response into national cost implications. Here, however, an additional measure is used-family hours worked. There are two reasons for reporting an analysis of total family hours as well as earnings. First, there is reason to suspect the reliability of earnings differences reported between the experimental and control groups. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that initially some experimentals and some controls reported net rather than the requested gross earnings, but that the experimentals learned more rapidly than did the controls that the gross earnings were to be reported.",https://doi.org/10.2307/144974,The Labor-Supply Response of the Family,https://openalex.org/W267512904

Design/methodology/approach Nationally representative survey data employed in this paper were collected in autumn 2017. The data collection utilized a multiphase sampling, and the interviews ( n =1004) were carried out on telephone to minimize selection-bias and produce demographically balanced data. Findings Over two-thirds (71 percent) of Finns do not expect technological unemployment to constitute a permanent problem in the digital economy. Nevertheless, 74 percent assume that technological unemployment will increase at least temporarily. A considerable majority (85 percent) also believe that future jobs will be more precarious. Younger generations, despite their currently weak position in the labor market, are surprisingly more optimistic in their predictions. Analysis of preferred policy responses support this paper’s main thesis that the Finnish view on the future of work is rather optimistic: education reforms and streamlining the current social security gather dedicated support, whereas more unconventional ideas such as basic income or work-sharing remain contested.

The question in this chapter is whether the ruling out of absolutisms and authoritarianisms associated with cultures of ethnicity, nationality and religion implies that well-being defined in terms of social care is an unsuitable goal of public policy. This chapter approaches the question by considering one proposal for a major reform of the tax-benefit system, which is rooted in the tradition of liberal individualism. It also uses Van Parijs's arguments for basic income in considering whether reforms in the distribution of rights and resources of this kind might in themselves be enough to correct the divergence between welfare and well-being. It also argues that many of the claims made by other political philosophers in support of the basic income proposal are unconvincing, because they do not address issues of social value directly. Unlike Van Parijs, who acknowledges that people would simply be able to live any life they chose however worthless, political philosophers suggest that society would be in some sense better through the freedom and equality bestowed by an unconditional income on all its members. This chapter suggests that, without other ways of promoting social value, there is little reason to believe that the Easterlin paradox would be overcome by this measure alone.",https://doi.org/10.1332/policypress/9781847420800.003.0012,"Justice, equality and social value",https://openalex.org/W2482827102

-5.3478303,19.972652,1,"Current debates concerning the future of social security provision in advanced capitalist states have raised a citizens‟ basic income (CBI) as a possible reform package. The proposal is based on the principles of individuality, universality and unconditionality and ensures a minimum income guarantee for all members of society. Implementing a CBI, thus, entails radical reform of existing patterns of welfare delivery and would bring into question the institutionalized relationship between work and welfare, upon which modern welfare states are premised. It follows that the practice of arguing for a CBI has tended to concentrate on issues regarding the role of the state in providing income security for all citizens and, in particular, to issues pertaining to the world of paid work. However such a concentration indicates bias in the approach to study and serves to confine the welfare reform agenda. The purpose of this thesis is to make a positive contribution to the CBI literature by examining the proposal from a feminist economics perspective. It is argued that a CBI has the potential to promote equal rights of freedom for men and women and provides the basis for the development and sustainability of new and liberating patterns of working and living. However, this particular aspect of the proposal will never be fully considered as long as the analytical framework employed is dominated by an adherence to neo-classical economic theory. Embracing a feminist economics perspective allows for the identification of the androcentric bias inherent within the neo-classical construct and further provides an alternative methodological approach that serves to open up the debate to incorporate a more realistic vision of the nature of modern socio-economic relationships.",,Arguing for a citizens basic income: a contribution from a feminist economics perspective,https://openalex.org/W2132329595

26.682014,-26.303558,3,"Universal Basic Income (UBI) is   concept that has recently begun to enter the popular political consciousness in the United States. It is defined as a regular cash income paid to all, on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It is invoked for   wide variety of political and social purposes, but is almost always presented as radically different from existing governmental welfare and transfer systems. Once   UBI is disaggregated into discrete policy components, it is possible to imagine to what degree existing programs share the benefits (and detriments) of   UBI to   greater or lesser degree, and reforms could be made to make existing programs more UBI-like, if that would be beneficial. 

This Article re-envisions   UBI as   series of reforms to one of the largest existing governmental transfer program in the US: the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is   work-conditional transfer program, and so any UBI-like reforms to the EITC will lack the defining characteristic of   UBI - that is it not work conditional. On the other hand,   number of reforms to the EITC would make the program more UBI-like. These include: (i) that the EITC phaseout be removed so the program is no longer means-tested (no means testing); (ii) that the program benefit be applied on an individual basis, decreasing the importance of support of custodial children (individuality); (iii) that the administration of the program be reformed so workers can receive payments throughout the year (regularity). By starting with the EITC and proposing   series of reforms to make it more UBI-like, one is able to accurately assess the differences between   UBI and at least one large governmental transfer program, diminishing the impression that   UBI is too utopian to actually become reality. One is further able to build on decades of tax policy research about the successes and failings of the EITC.

Of particular importance to both supporters and critics of the UBI is its lack of work requirement, and that is often its most philosophically controversial element. By exploring UBI-like reforms to the EITC (which is work conditional), this paper relaxes   defining aspect of the UBI - that it be free from work requirements. For some supporters, this makes any comparison between the program proposed and   UBI nonsensical. But the EITC is already more like   UBI than many work-conditional transfer programs, and reforms could make its work-conditionality even less problematic. Still, maintaining the EITC's structure as   work-conditional transfer program distinguishes it dramatically from   true UBI, and loses   number of the central benefits of   UBI. It is the premise of this paper that an exploration of   partial UBI of this nature -   compromise - is useful for future discussion of the issue, even if the proposed program is   distinct second best. It is not   coincidence that Senator Kamala Harris,   contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has proposed   UBI-like program, the LIFT the Middle Class Act, which shares many of the features of the reforms proposed in this Article.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3338468,EITC For All: A Universal Basic Income Compromise Proposal,https://openalex.org/W2916230795

In order to illustrate this argument, a post-Keynesian input-output model for the German economy is constructed, incorporating the input-output structure of the German economy and a full representation of the circular flow of income between institutional sectors. In line with post-Keynesian theory, final demand consists of autonomous and induced components. In the household sector, two types of households are distinguished according to their main income source (labour or capital income). The model is used to explore the effects of two possible policy measures. The first is a shift from material consumption (industrial products) to immaterial consumption (services). The second is a massive investment programme in energy-saving technologies. The model suggests that these policy measures do not generally improve all indicators of sustainability. In the first case, unemployment is reduced, but the income share of capital rises at the expense of labour. While the increase in employment is beneficial, the associated increase in poverty among worker households is problematic for social sustainability.

This phenomenon is referred to as gender-based violence (GBV). Gender-based violence has many manifestations, including sexual assault, femicide, and intimate partner violence (IPV), as well as dowry-related violence, early or forced marriage and pregnancy, female genital mutilation, elder abuse, human trafficking, sexual harassment, cyber abuse, and many other forms, both visible and invisible. Crucially, GBV does not simply occur in the context of inter-personal relationships or as the result of perpetration by ‘bad men’; rather, GBV is a systemic issue that seizes upon and operates through longstanding pathologies and power dynamics—patriarchy, racism, colonialism, and transphobia to name few—rendering diverse people more vulnerable to victimization on the basis of their identity. Strategies, policies, and programs focused on ensuring victims and survivors can achieve economic security will form a vital component of any serious plan to address GBV.

The immediate goals of the proposal are to highlight, through compensation, the reality that the productive activities carried on in households are of essential importance for the whole economy and society, and to enable the people who carry out these essential activities to do so without having to short-change the care work because of the need to earn money through the market. The CS concept builds on literature on Basic Income Guarantees (BIG) and on feminist economics, which tends to be skeptical of BIG proposals. By addressing intra-household allocations, CS shows how a basic income system can promote a more caring democracy and a more partnership-oriented socioeconomic system that rewards the essential work of care.

It can be defended from both a liberal-libertarian perspective as a replacement for existing benefits and social insurance (with Friedman often cited in this sense, although his negative tax proposal is fora family-based system; Capitalism and Freedom, p. 159),or from a progressive standpoint, in which case the basic income would be added to most existing benefits and social insurance. It is more in this second sense that the BIEN (2013) advocates a basic income, although the liberal aspect of the measure is also assumed: It's the most liberal solidarity principle one can get, as it ensures individual existence and social cohesion, without the rigidity of interventionism and no oppressing bureaucracy.

Analyzing UBI from an ideal-theoretical perspective requires a comparison of the justice performance of ideal welfare regimes instead of comparing isolated institutional designs. This holistic perspective allows for a more systematic consideration of issues like institutional complementarity. I compare three potential ideal welfare regimes from a liberal-egalitarian perspective of justice: An ideal social democratic regime, a mixed regime containing a moderate UBI and a maximal UBI regime where UBI replaces most of the welfare state. These regimes are evaluated with respect to three aspects of justice performance: the scope and neutrality of opportunities provided, institutional complementarities with a dynamic, globalized economy and the policy feedback effects on the political stability of liberal-egalitarian political coalitions.

In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is a purely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Both the global financial crisis from 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 illustrate the importance of social and legal policy, and suggest it is time to learn.

Providing an income to all its members on an individual basis, without means-test or the requirement to be in the labor market, BI offers every citizen access to a guaranteed income, regardless of marital or employment status. Despite the fundamental and universal importance of care, the responsibility of providing care and the necessity of receiving care have not been sufficiently recognized and rewarded during the development of welfare states. Providing care has been further problematized as during this development, eligibility for social security benefits has been connected to the employment status of claimants. It is expected, and is sometimes hoped, that BI will to some extent untangle the links between welfare and labor and enhance the recognition and valuation of a wide variety of unpaid activities, including care work, which are currently carried out mostly unpaid and largely by women. It is also expected that BI will address the problem of undervaluation of paid care work in the labor market.

This is explored alongside historical demands for a Universal Basic Income. Twin aims have permeated formal policy directions: the need to simplify the systems of benefit and to examine novel ways of ensuring either a more equal or a more equitable distribution of income. While not the only rationale for reform, the simplification agenda remains important.

There have been heated discussions on the benefits and costs of adopting basic income as a universal income support program among policy makers and academics in South Korea. However, one of the problems in the discourse of basic income discussion in South Korea has been a lack of clear definition of basic income. In this study, we develop a basic income fidelity index (BIFI) that can be applied to basic income programs to show how fully a program fits to the basic income concept. Such an index can be useful in making the terminologies and concepts of basic income clearer. We test feasibility of BIFI by applying it to four different case examples of basic income; Alaska Permanent Fund, UK Child Trust Fund, Switzerland’s Basic Income Plan, and Finland’s Basic Income Experiment. We show BIFI can be a useful tool to differentiate various types of basic income.

Unlike Western welfare-state regimes in which the politics of austerity has dominated, the politics of welfare expansion has been noticeable in East Asian welfare regimes. This paper will analyse whether these changes have fundamentally dismantled the productivist feature where social policy is subordinate to economic objectives. While the trajectories are different depending on different political institutional contexts, this study shows that there are two strong signs that these states are moving out of their productivist nature and also that they are in the process of establishing their own welfare states. Japan seems to still be a productivist welfare-state regime struggling to accommodate rapid socio-economic changes, whereas Korea is a welfare state regime with strong liberal characteristics via modern welfare politics. Since the needs for social policy expansion in China correspond to economic and political needs, the productivist feature has been significantly weakened. However, this study argues that these transitory welfare regimes are in critical stages of formulating their new welfare regimes and that welfare politics based on contingent events could affect the future trajectories of these regimes.",https://doi.org/10.1163/156853112x650827,End of the Era of Productivist Welfare Capitalism?

As in regard to many other type of assets, the distribution of time is pretty unfair, as well as it is the value consideration of the time allocated for different people to different activities. The distribution of time, as well as what people can or cannot do with their time, is a key issue among feminist debates. The main argument is that time allocation to paid and unpaid work is very different and unfair between genders. Women allocate much more time to unpaid work, and men, on the contrary allocate much more time to paid work. This has a reasonable and direct consequence in terms of income generation. This unequal distribution of time (and work) represents the main obstacle to women’s economic autonomy and to overcome gender income gaps.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0012,Basic Income and Time Use Democratization,https://openalex.org/W2473693766

This “macro-experiment” sheds light on the community-level realities of basic income. I describe evidence showing that wages offered by Dauphin businesses increased. Additionally, labor market participation fell. By ignoring the social interactions that characterize real-world community contexts, randomized studies underestimate the decline in labor market participation and its impact on employers.

Estimating the possible consequences of introducing a basic income, however, remains an equation with too many unknowns. As a result, even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded unprecedented measures in the social sphere, preference was given to traditional mechanisms to support the economy, employment, and living standards. The results of experiments with basic income, carried out over the past half-century, due to their limited scope, are still clearly insufficient to make an unambiguous conclusion about the viability of this scheme and the feasibility of its implementation on a national scale. At the same time, these experiments showed that basic income, when incorporated into existing social protection systems, can become an effective tool for smoothing regional disparities, the vulnerable position of a certain age and gender groups, as well as improving physical and mental health indicators. Moreover, they allow us, with some caution, to conclude that concerns about the negative impact of basic income on employment are grossly exaggerated.

The report notes: It is clear that since 2008, no progress has been made against the target to halve the gap in employment outcomes within a decade (by 2018). The proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples aged 15–64 years who are employed fell from 53.8 per cent in 2008 to 47.5 per cent in 2012–13. In addition to the fall in Indigenous employment, the proportion of non-Indigenous Australians who are employed rose from 75.0 per cent to 75.6 per cent. Consequently, between 2008 and 2012–13 there has been an increase of 6.9 percentage points in the employment gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous working age people (up from 21.2 to 28.1 percentage points).

The rich set of details that are provided in this database allows a more precise empirical analysis of the above relationships than has been possible with PSID, CPS and other previously used databases. By restricting the sample to a relatively, homogeneous segment of the work force its is possible to isolate better the effects of unemployment replacement income and job search duration on the migration decision of unemployed workers without the confounding effects of the variety of demographic factors that previous studies have shown to influence labour force migration. The results suggest that for unemployed prime working age males, the probability of migration is negatively related to the level of unemployment replacement income that is received and positively related to the percentage of the total household income that was contributed by the worker prior to becoming unemployed. Furthermore, by using a quadratic specification the duration of an unemployment spell is shown to have a positive affect on the probability of migration up to a certain point and negative thereafter. The latter result is in contrast to the findings of some of the previous research, which suggests an unambigious negative relationship between the duration of unemployment and the probability of migration.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00036849300000069,"Replacement income, duration of unemployment and the migration of unemployed prime age males",https://openalex.org/W2061187454
52.60964,-17.996445,3,"Universal basic income would provide everyone with a regular cash payment and is, as van Parijs (1992, p 1) observes, a ‘beautifully, disarmingly simple idea’ – as well as one with potentially profound implications. Under conventional social security policies, the groups of people to which transfers are made are restricted on the basis of conditions of category, circumstance and conduct (or behaviour) (Clasen and Clegg, 2007). Basic income sweeps all that away. Box 13.1 summarises the main features and advantages of universal basic income that arise from its simple and unconditional nature. Universal basic income’s appeal traverses a range of political perspectives (Torry, 2016a), giving rise to the common portrayal of basic income as ‘neither right nor left but forward’. At basic income’s heart is a compromise between ‘justice’ and ‘efficiency’ (van Parijs, 1990); proponents argue it is uniquely capable of fulfilling the protective functions of social security while minimising harmful labour market distortions (Martinelli, 2017a). Left-wing inclinations towards equality, solidarity and redistribution are coupled with libertarian ideals of freedom and efficiency. The juxtaposition of political philosophical values enshrined in basic income has a long pedigree; the modern concept can be traced back to Thomas Paine in the 18th century, where it was justified as compensation for infringement of inalienable common property rights through land enclosure (van Parijs, 1992). Since that time, interest in the idea has waxed and waned. However, in the past decade – and especially since 2013 – interest has soared. A number of developments illustrate this shift: a Swiss decision (in 2013) to have a referendum (held in 2016) on whether to grant every citizen an unconditional payment; recent experiments in Namibia and India, and a host of experiments ongoing or planned in Finland, Kenya, the Netherlands, Canada and California; a general flurry of media and public scrutiny; and the growing membership – and sheer number – of organisations supportive of (or at least interested in) the idea of basic income.",https://doi.org/10.51952/9781447339489.ch013,Making it simple?

Atkinson's desire to meld social welfare and the income data led him to specify the social welfare function in terms of income. Atkinson sought a very simple specification of W—one that could easily be applied to the income data and yet would capture the full range of ethical judgments from the utilitarian to Rawlsian. He achieved this with three highly simplified and heroic assumptions: the social welfare function is utilitarian, everyone has identical tastes, and utility exhibits diminishing private marginal utility of income. Atkinson's assumptions were widely adopted in applied social welfare analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-012699051-5.50005-4,The social welfare function in policy analysis,https://openalex.org/W971466962

-0.96092385,49.07965,5,"Abstract Violence against women is understood as a public health issue that has long-term health consequences for women. Economic inequality and women’s economic dependence on men make women vulnerable to violence. One approach to addressing poverty is through basic income, a cash transfer for all individuals which is not dependent on their employment status. This paper examines the relationship between basic income and violence against women by surveying different forms of cash transfer programs and their association with intimate partner violence, sexual exploitation, and systemic violence. Previous reviews report that cash transfers can be associated with decreased intimate partner violence. This review goes beyond existing systematic reviews by including intimate partner violence, sexual exploitation, and systemic violence for a broader understanding of how cash transfers relate to violence against women. Search databases include EBSCOhost search with Medline, Social Science Abstracts, APA PsychINFO, Social Work Abstracts. Search terms were “basic income” or “cash transfer” and “women” and “violence” or “homicide” or “sexual risk.” Other terms searched were “indigenous” or “colonial” or “systemic”. This search included articles reporting on cash transfers as the exposure and an indicator of violence against women as the outcome. Articles were excluded if it did not fit these criteria and were not written in English. This search yielded 28 articles that described intimate partner violence (emotional, physical, or sexual), 15 articles that described sexual exploitation, and no articles describing systemic violence against women. We used other supplemental articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria to pinpoint gaps in literature on systemic violence. These papers were analyzed through a feminist lens, an intersectional approach in addition to other theories. This search resulted in 43 articles. Consistent with other reviews on this subject matter, many recipients of cash transfers reported feeling empowered by it. A large proportion of articles found that cash transfers have a decreased association with physical forms of IPV overall, however some articles report decreased, increased, or unchanged outcomes for emotional IPV, such as aggression, controlling behaviours, or threats. Cash transfers may also be associated with reduced sexual exploitation as nine out of 11 studies reported that participants reduced their number of sex trade interactions due to having their financial needs met and studies also reported their perceived increased autonomy in sexual decision-making. This article outlines the gaps in literature, including the examination of cash transfers and systemic violence that can guide future research to best understand how cash transfer impact violence against women.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2022-0032,Basic Income and Violence Against Women: A Review of Cash Transfer Experiments,https://openalex.org/W4390802210

Although the discussion about basic income has a long tradition within the literature of political philosophy, van Parijs’ contribution is regarded as the most systematic work in this area. Following his line of reasoning, an UBI is the consequence of the claim to increase real freedom of the least-advantaged members of society while remaining neutral to their different life plans. While discussing van Parijs’ claim of an UBI to maximize real freedom, the focus shifts to Dworkin’s approach to resource egalitarianism that is central to this claim. It relies on a distribution of resources that is both ambition-sensitive and endowment-insensitive. Afterwards, ways of financing an UBI are studied from a normative perspective and the operationalization of this concept is discussed.

While recent studies recognise the multidimensionality of the UBI proposal, we still know little about to what extent support for UBI is unambiguously supported or rejected. We show that the public holds distinct but related opinions towards three dimensions of UBI: universalism, redistribution and unconditionality. The higher and lower educated are equally ambivalent towards the policy, suggesting a lack of political entrenchment towards UBI in Dutch society. Post hoc comparisons show that key demographics and constituencies support some dimensions while rejecting others, enabling both compromise and division on the issue. Despite these distinct controversies, however, the strong correlation between attitudinal dimensions suggests that survey experiments tend to overstate the degree of multidimensionality by ignoring the strong commonalities in support for policy aspects.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ijsw.12607,Dimensions of controversy: Investigating the structure of public support for universal basic income in the Netherlands,https://openalex.org/W4379530175

We then consider the potential contribution of universal basic income (UBI) to dealing causally with this public health problem.

2.2780962,-11.96401,1,"Social security programmes may be divided into two broad groups of pro grammes, those concerned with income security and those concerned with op portunity security. Income security programmes may be further divided into positive transfer programmes, where there is a cash flow from the government to the individual, and negative transfer programmes, which are a component of the taxation system. Positive transfer programmes may be universal or limited, the main limitation being benefits subject to a means test. Positive transfer programmes may also be classified as to whether they are income based measures, distinguish- . ing between income replacement and income supplement programmes; or whether they are expenditure based, whereby the beneficiary receives either full or partial campensation for expenditure he has made or is assumed to have made. The philosophy lying behind income security programmes may be related to the principle of either individual need or social right. The former principle tends to be associated with programmes which are limited in nature while universal programmes tend to be based on the principle of social right. In the past most of the income security programmes in Australia have been based on the principle of individual need, but since 1972 there has been a marked shift to programmes based on social right, particularly the policy of abolishing the means test on aged pensions and the introduction of Medibank. Social right policies, in general, tend to be more costly and alleviate less need per dollar of outlay than individual need programmes. Apart from the move towards social right programmes, there has been an increasing lack of coordination between existing and proposed programmes. Although an inter-departmental committee has been established to investigate this problem, it is unlikely that any real change will eventuate from that source in the near future. What is required in Australia today is not further studies of poverty or the prescription of new programmes, but an explicit statement of social welfare philosophy on which programmes are to be based, and the establishment of an organisation whose primary and perhaps sole task is to co-ordinate social security programmes. 1. J. Cutt, New perspectives on welfare reform, Social Security Quarterly, 1973-74 (3), 1. 2. A universal scheme is one applicable to what is known in statistics as the 'population', which is the number of individuals with the specified characteristics. In this sense, the 'population' does not mean all individuals in the nation. 3. See Compensation and Rehabilitation in Australia, Report of the National Committee of Inquiry, Canberra: Australian Gov ernment Printer, 1974. On the other hand the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry did not come down in favour of either kind of benefits scheme. See National Superannuation in Australia, Interim Report of the National Super annuation Committee of Inquiry, Canberra : Australian Government Printer, 1974, p. 20 and Chapter 9. 4. The distinction between an income supplement programme and an expenditure based programme is somewhat arbitrary in that income supplement programmes are also inherently designed to provide additional funds to the individual to offset assumed higher expenditure because of prescribed circumstances (for example having children under 16 years of age). In this paper the distinction is based on the degree of regularity of the payment.

It must be admitted that concern about lack of coordination existed within the labour government. It existed in 1972 because the need for coordination was inherent in the functions given to the Social Welfare Commission when it was later establish ed. The fact that the Commission did nothing about coordinating anything reflects not only its own failing but also to a large extent the lack of willingness of a departmentalized structure of administration and its ministers to be coordinated, a lack illustrated by the subsequent establishment of another coordinating review body. This ludicrous position was heigh tened by the submission of numerous reports to the government on welfare matters, all of which represented individual assessments of the nation's ills and prescriptions for their alleviation. In 1975 it was decided to appoint an interdepart mental committee to report on coordination, and presumably to indicate how this can be achieved. Little can be expected from this because the real solution is the necessity to reform the structure of government by converting its existing depart mental structure into a functional structure, with a significantly smaller number of separate functions than the number of existing departments. Hence it is likely that this IDC will conform to the definition given to that term by outsiders—an Inter-Departmental Confrontation designed to Create Intense Delaying Camouflage as justification for the absence of Intel lectually Demanding Consideration of the need for Integrated Dynamic Change.",https://doi.org/10.1177/002087287702000105,Income Security Programmes and the Philosophy of Social Security Policy,https://openalex.org/W2096307221

I argue against such ‘UBI-first’ approaches. Compared to UBI proposals for other purposes, a UBI sufficient or near-sufficient for minimising domination at work would be especially demanding in two ways. First, the level of the grant would be more demanding compared to UBIs suitable for other purposes, in order for workers to be able to credibly threaten to leave their jobs. Secondly, the maintenance of the grant must also meet strict criteria. The demanding level of the grant must be effectively secured against reduction, allowing workers to plan on its long-term acceptability; and in order to avoid increased state domination it must assume the status of an entitlement rather than a gift that may be withdrawn, through stabilisation against political change or some other means. These difficulties render UBI-first approaches doubtful at best, and an unhelpful distraction from other, more fruitful strategies at worst.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11158-020-09487-9,"Work, Domination, and the False Hope of Universal Basic Income",https://openalex.org/W3094470519

The relevance of the study is due to the need to increase the level of social quality under conditions of exacerbation of risks and threats produced by new (digital) economy’s drivers and the coronavirus crisis’s scaling. New dangers and restrictions on social and labor development emerge under the influence of challenges posed by the “big bang-1” and the “big bang-2”, which stipulates the search for new “pillars” of distribution relations and social policy. The aim of the article is scientific argumentation of the institute of social and labor reality of the XXI century, unconditional basic income, in the context of building a new system of social protection on a post-industrial basis in accordance with principles of coherence, accessibility, transparency and fairness in order to ensure a socially acceptable standard and quality of life. Among the article’s elements of novelty is the author’s concept of unconditional basic income as one of the leading components of the new social contract; coverage of socio-economic essence and substantiation of scientific and applied meaning of unconditional basic income under conditions of new (digital) economy and network society development.

So far, the basic income debate addresses gender only in so far as it would raise the income of the poorest, of whom a larger proportion are women.

It could be financed by an EU flat tax of 0.2% on all household income, assuming that it would also be taxed nationally as income. Most member states and virtually all families with children aged under 6 would be net gainers. We simulate two versions of EU CBI, with the benefit rate of â‚¬50 per month adjusted or not for differences in purchasing power between member states. In general, fiscal flows between member states, and also poverty reduction, would be smaller under the adjusted version. The political feasibility of such a scheme might be questioned, especially within the net contributor countries.

As a result, exploitation of the workers who are constantly occupied with “self-realization” becomes even more effective. Free time becomes a fetish — a means of productively engaging people’s energy through various scenarios in which they are (supposedly) enjoying their leisure time pursuits. Is it even possible to undo the fetishization of free time? And if so, how else might we conceptualize it? In seeking an answer to these questions the author continues the discussion of akrasia launched by Michail Maiatsky in his article “Liberation from Work, Unconditional Income and Foolish Will” (Logos, 2015, 25[3]) in which Maiatsky expressed a well-founded fear that a contemporary “post-Nietzschean” person might respond to the “gift of unconditional freedom” with an irrational desire to test the boundaries of that boon and end up as Dostoyevsky said “living by his own foolish will.” A hypothesis to address that fear argues that the intentions behind such an “akratic rebellion” are inherently rooted in the fetishistic logic that dominates both current perceptions of free time and also the debate about providing a basic income. The akratic reaction is a form of phantasmatic acting out of the painful suspicion that efforts to reach liberation could turn into another form of bondage. The roots of this bind can be found in the historically embedded form of economic organization, which is based on a sense of dire emergency. We owe this understanding of the “economic dispositive” to the work of Giorgio Agamben, but it is already discernible in Xenophon. We can find an indication of its dominant position in modern economic thinking in Nikolay Sieber’s (1844–1888) criticism of the postulates of the “subjective school” of economics. Because the economy acquires a sacred aspect within this dispositive, akrasia may be compared with a sacrilegious trespass of its boundaries. However, Agamben proposes that challenging any form of the solemn ceremonies of capitalism’s priesthood in a way that is not merely imaginary must necessarily be a kind of profanation.",https://doi.org/10.22394/0869-5377-2019-1-159-186,Defetishizing Free Time: From Akrasia to Profanation,https://openalex.org/W4230404268

Three areas were identified that‐would seem to hold some promise for incrementally expanding social security: expanding coverage of social insurance, expanding social assistance (particularly child support grants) and low‐wage public employment schemes.

We begin with feminism, the definition of which is our first problem: to what extent does it interact with other ideologies across the political spectrum?

It states that the cost of providing everyone with a decent income floor, beneath which no one would fall, is out of reach for governments and public finance. Income taxes would have to be raised to unacceptable levels to accomplish this, the objection claims. This paper addresses the objection by demonstrating its weaknesses and showing that a universal basic income is affordable. It is in fact more affordable than the current wasteful array of often counter-productive, bureaucratic income security programs. Better results can be achieved with lower costs by implementing basic income, or a guaranteed livable income. This study does not seek any cuts to vital public programs such as universal health care or education to attain the result of a basic income sufficient to cover one's needs for food, modest shelter etc. at all times.

Beveridge's vision, 50 years ago, of a society protected by a national system of social insurance has never been realized and, instead, social assistance, designed as a residual and diminishing means of support, has gradually expanded to make up for the inadequacies of a national insurance system which was at first neglected, then attacked by governments. This important shift in the founding principles of the British income maintenance programme occurred without any public or parliamentary debate and without public acknowledgement by government that it was happening. As a result, British social assistance provision has continually been stretched beyond reasonable limits.

Besides, as Rawls desires, for our work to be meaningful and our life worthwhile, we should institutionalize basic income because it can improve workers’ bargaining power and their attitude toward work, in addition to enhancing their leisure time.

How valuable are these programs for U.S. households? Are there simpler, welfare-improving ways to transfer resources that are supported by a majority? What are the macroeconomic effects of such alternatives? We answer these questions in an equilibrium, life-cycle model with single and married households who face idiosyncratic productivity risk, in the presence of costly children and potential skill losses of females associated with non-participation. Our findings show that a potential revenue-neutral elimination of the welfare state generates large welfare losses in the aggregate. Yet, most households support eliminating current transfers since losses are concentrated among a small group. We find that a Universal Basic Income program does not improve upon the current system. If instead per-person transfers are implemented alongside a proportional tax, a Negative Income Tax experiment, there are transfer levels and associated tax rates that improve upon the current system.

The struggles of the unemployed workers in Argentina during the 1990s should not be classified as a defensive struggle for inclusion in the labour market, or as a demand for social security (although these demands were significant in the Piqueteros’ agenda); rather they should be seen as advancing significant changes at identity/organizational, socioeconomic and political institutional levels. These changes deserve special attention in terms of their significance for the reshaping of the labour question in the twenty‐first century.

A comparison with actual rates provides an estimate of the Dividend’s impact. This does not provide strong evidence of an effect. However, incorporating information on Dividend amounts suggests the size of payments is important, with larger amounts reducing crime.

-11.135974,-49.13737,0,"ABSTRACT The basic thesis of this paper is that a necessary condition for the re-establishment of full employment without a runaway inflation is a change of attitudes and institutions concerning wage-fixing which puts more emphasis on the effects of rates of pay on the expansion of employment opportunities and much less emphasis on their effects on the real incomes of those already in employment. A necessary condition for such changes would be to develop further fiscal and social welfare measures to promote an acceptable distribution of income. Unfortunately it is possible that two very desirable developments — namely, labour participation in decision-making in industry and the introduction of new technologies — may make this particular wage-fixing problem more, rather than less, acute. The reforms discussed to meet this problem cover: the use of Keynesian demand-management policies to keep the money national income on a steady but moderate growth path; measures to restrain the setting of monopolistic practices by trade unions; a system of national arbitration and a possible inflation tax to curb excessive wage increases; an integrated reconstruction of social benefits and direct taxation; the substitution of expenditure instead of income as the basis of a progressive direct tax; the possible introduction of an annual wealth tax; and the reform of capital transfer tax to fall progressively on the beneficiaries of gifts and bequests.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400013465,"Full Employment, New Technologies and the Distribution of Income",https://openalex.org/W2000121503

All that without mentioning the ever-haunting specter of automation-induced unemployment and, finally, the outbreak of a world-reaching pandemic: these are some of the ongoing cataclysmic trends that are making an everincreasing number of academics, policymakers and multilateral organizations revisit the adoption of Universal Basic Income (UBI) models. The idea of furnishing guaranteed, unconditional and universal basic income for people within an assigned geographical locality – and potentially the entire globe – has ebbed and flown from the pages of authors of all walks of the political spectrum for over two centuries. It appears, though, that such an idea is regaining momentum at this point in history, a somewhat unexpected moment, given the worldwide rise of nationalistic and illiberalism worldviews. The ambition of this proposal is not to promote an exhaustive comparative assessment of competing proposals currently taking place – or being aspired at – around the world. Instead, this working paper stands as an introductory effort to be followed by a more robust case study of existing schemes, which should bind them under the theories of Multipolarity. This proposal launches the cornerstone of a debate assessing the concrete costs and political coordination challenges that are likely to arise in a scenario of massive and ideally genuine universal effort to start or scale-up existing UBI initiatives through the deployment of digital financing techniques, including its most disruptive variations such as cryptocurrencies.",https://doi.org/10.12893/gjcpi.2020.2.4,Locally Universal: Universal Basic Income Policies in the Post-Pandemic World-Order,https://openalex.org/W4391498081
-5.145785,8.102742,5,"The actualisation of research interest in the issue of basic income is driven by growing inequalities in various aspects of people's lives and the unfair distribution of material and social goods in capitalist states. Providing a basic income opens up opportunities to enhance social guarantees and the standard of living for citizens.&#x0D; The article examines the ideological paradigms of the social consequences of implementing basic income. It is shown that in capitalist states, this payment, judging by numerous experiments, is being implemented in transitional forms. Its introduction serves as one of the adaptive mechanisms for capital to adapt to the modern conditions of profit extraction. The antagonistic interests of ruling classes and the majority of citizens, as well as the fragmentation of the private interests of the latter, do not allow the widespread implementation of basic income in full accordance with its fundamental criteria. The main criteria include universality – payment to all citizens, unconditionality – payment regardless of employment and other characteristics of the economic and social status of individuals, and regularity – payment throughout the entire lives of basic income recipients.&#x0D; The possibility of adhering to the fundamental criteria for providing basic income is justified in the implementation of a socialist paradigm for the development of modern states. It is demonstrated that in contemporary Russia, an evolutionary resolution of accumulated contradictions and a phased implementation of a new socialist development paradigm are possible. This could potentially be a chain of humanitarian transformations, conditioned by the circumstances that have emerged. The beginning of this transformation has already been initiated after February 2022 with the expansion of state ownership in key economic sectors, the introduction of state planning within them, the demand for new personnel prioritising collective and state values to address these issues. All this does not contradict the development of market sectors of the economy, oriented toward individual citizens' needs and the development of their diverse personal potential, as well as servicing state ownership in key sectors and facilitating comprehensive international economic connections.&#x0D; Sociological research conducted under the author's guidance has shown that potential recipients of basic income in Russia confirm their intentions to develop their human potential and consider it advisable to conduct experiments on the provision of basic income.&#x0D; In conclusion, it is concluded that the introduction of basic income, in conjunction with other instruments of socialist evolution of Russian society and the state, represents an opportunity for the development and realisation of human potential in our country.",https://doi.org/10.19181/vis.2023.14.4.2,The Basic Income Paradigm and Its Impact on Human Development Opportunities,https://openalex.org/W4390190688
-3.059694,53.14812,5,"Conceptualizing the “Right” to Avoid Origin Deprivation: International Law and Domestic Implementation By Alice Diver A proclamation of a right is not the fulfillment of a right any more than an airplane schedule is a flight. A proclamation may or may not be an initial step toward the fulfilment of the right listed. It is frequently the substitute of the promise in the place of the fulfilment. —Henry Shue, Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U. S. Foreign Policy Introduction As Jack Donnelly has suggested, at the level of domestic implementation, “identity is entitled to protection only where it is an autonomous expression of the rights and values of those who carry it” (214). Although there are no explicit rights to avoid origin deprivation (“genetic non-ancestry”) within international law, a number of related entitlements to access certain aspects of genetic identity do appear to exist. These include such ostensibly justiciable concepts as the right to possess a name1 or nationality,2 and the duty upon states to respect “cultural integrity.”3 Broader, normative principles such as the best interests of the child,4 equality of treatment and non-discrimination5 also merit discussion here, given that they are often either embedded in domestic legislation or have provided useful guidance for domestic proceedings.6 This article will attempt to conceptualize as a basic human right the hypothetical right to avoid origin deprivation. The existence of such a right, or rather the need for such a right to be more fully articulated and more consistently implemented by domestic legal systems, is underpinned by the considerable amount of research highlighting the wide range of harms that can attach to genetic kinlessness. This article will ask whether such a right might yet be found to carry sufficient weight to “embed” itself as usefully juridical concept within the sphere of domestic child law, especially where private law issues such as family formation, information release, kin contact, or welfare paramountcy arise. Arguably, domestic interpretations of many socio-economic entitlements, such as the right to respect for family life, Adoption & Culture 3 (2012) 142 are often almost entirely resource-dependant, and therefore tend to be viewed more as privileges than as fully justiciable human rights. The “right” to receive information or to be afforded socio-cultural heritage protections are key examples (Colliver, et al.; and Marks).7 This article also makes particular reference to one closed records jurisdiction (Québec) where the rights of many adoptees have been almost completely overruled by the use of non-disclosure vetoes on the basis of protecting the juridically heavier interests of natal parents. This is so despite the enactment of two regional charters aimed at the incorporation of basic human rights, and in spite of the scrutiny of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. Committee Country Reports are referred to here with a view to gauging whether the guidance contained in them might eventually persuade domestic jurists and policy-makers that origin deprivation ought to occur exceptionally rather than normatively as a consequence of social kinship. Essentially, if identity rights in international law engender a corresponding right to “repatriate” with one’s genitors, this raises the possibility that a number of rights infringements might have arisen in respect of donor anonymity, closed birth records, and non-disclosure vetoes. If one accepts that the “universal protection of relationships with significant others is in fact protection of the distinctness and the uniqueness in the individual,” then it may be difficult to justify the complete loss of genetic connection as a means to enabling social kinship (Ronen 151). The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Ratification of the Convention may nevertheless encourage domestic reform. —Barbara Stark, International Family Law: An Introduction Ronen has described The Children’s Convention as “the most authoritative legal text on children in international law,” enshrining as it does the primacy of child welfare (148). Michael Freeman has further argued that it represents a “celebration of children’s rights [which] has reached a crescendo” (273). By emphasizing the key concept of human dignity, and by highlighting the need to take into account the wishes and feelings of children, the Convention has, to an extent...",https://doi.org/10.1353/ado.2012.0003,Conceptualizing the “Right” to Avoid Origin Deprivation: International Law and Domestic Implementation,https://openalex.org/W1525637656

One suggested solution to this problem has gained more popular and academic support in recent years: the idea of a universal, unconditional basic income (UBI). This study, therefore, examines whether and how UBI could support social security systems in the UK, Germany and Sweden in order to achieve their aims and fulfil their functions, and thus to improve insufficient social security.

Since effectiveness and efficiency describe the functionality of social security systems, the study focuses on these two aspects. These aspects will be used to theoretically discuss expected effects of UBI along with the main aims and functions of key policies in each country in regard to their effectiveness and efficiency.

In comparison with current social security schemes in each country, the study demonstrates that UBI is able to deal better with several traditional and new risks, despite problems with higher expectations and living standards. UBI provides basic needs and will especially pull risk away from people in need. Additionally, it alleviates poverty and fosters social cohesion.

Interviewees expressed optimistic views about the future labour market and dismissed the scenario, preferring the option of job‐creation. Students claimed that people would become useless members of society by not working, which argument echoes the Hungarian government's discourse about the need for work‐based society. Students also stressed that work gives meaning to life.

The core of our analysis is centred on evaluating how each proposal might address poverty in B.C. along intersectional lines, and according to the key dimensions or principles of poverty mitigation and prevention outlined by the B.C. government in its poverty reduction strategy: affordability, opportunity, reconciliation, and social. We also draw on insights regarding the systemic barriers that contribute to greater risk and prevalence of poverty for people whose identities are situated at various axes of difference. We not only consider how the proposals may produce “tangible” outcomes, but also focus on the various ways in which they could transform experiences within and beyond the system of programs, or erect barriers that are not immediately obvious or that may not exist for a “neutral” subject. We demonstrate that the basic income and basic services approaches both have immediate practical value, as well as exhibiting transformative potential, though such impacts largely hinge on how the policies are envisioned and implemented.

3.5620162,-29.37224,0,"Summary The main claim of this paper is that in a world of equal entitlements to work rights the justification for a basic income is stronger, and that its level should be higher, the higher the level of unemployment or job scarcity. Point of departure is an economy with job scarcity. A fair way to deal with job scarcity is to grant everybody an equal right to work, where these rights can be freely traded. It turns out that such a Labour Rights scheme and a basic income scheme are equivalent. The equivalence is that the price of Labour Rights and the unemployment benefit corresponds to the income tax rate and basic income respectively. The tax rate can thus be considered as what workers have to pay to appropriate scarce job assets. Both schemes allow that some people voluntarily abstain from doing paid work, in return for a financial compensation. Therefore, the advantages in terms of equity and efficiency of a Labour Rights scheme equally apply to the basic income proposal. This analysis provides an argument against cutting unemployment and social assistance benefits during economic downturns and it offers new insights to evaluate the parasitism and exploitation objection raised against basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0770451800011489,"Basic income, unemployment and job scarcity",https://openalex.org/W3124720853

The article argues that the disability perspective is essential for understanding and promoting social justice, although it is often disregarded by critical thinkers and social activists. The article looks at three prominent strategies for achieving social justice under conditions of capitalism: economically, by decommodifying labour; culturally, by deconstructing self-sufficiency; and politically, by transnationalising democracy. The disability perspective reveals that decommodification of labour requires enhancement of disability support, deconstruction of self-sufficiency requires valorisation of disability-illuminated interdependence, and transnationalisation of democracy requires scrutiny of the transnational production of impairments.

Due to socioeconomic changes and successive government policies over the past three decades, the contributory principle, which was a cornerstone of social security reconstruction after World War II, has been in remarkable decline. At the same time contributions to the National Insurance Fund increased significantly and continues to represent a substantial form of total social security revenue. The contributory principle has a broad public appeal, but National Insurance does not figure prominently in public debates and the system is poorly understood. Recent policies have added to the ambiguity as to how far the contributory principle confers social rights, and have further eroded its rationale. The article states that this situation is not matched by developments in other European countries. Despite substantial reforms and heated debates marked by controversy, the prospect for social insurance and the contributory principle appears considerably better than in the UK. One major explanation is, the article argues, the distinctive notion of social insurance in Britain and particularly the lack of “wage‐replacement” transfers. Elsewhere in Europe, earnings‐related transfers sustain a very different incentive structure, institutional involvement and wider public participation in matters of social insurance.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9515.00258,Social Insurance and the Contributory Principle: A Paradox in Contemporary British Social Policy,https://openalex.org/W2077620406

Flat rate pensions and widespread home ownership have ensured relative equality in older life. However, in response to perceived fiscal pressures generated by population ageing, Australia has increasingly shifted its policy settings, encouraging private savings over public risk pooling. Private savings are increasingly supported by public subsidy through tax policy. This has led to overlapping policy priorities, as public subsidies are used both as incentives to promote savings and as social policy instruments to promote adequate living standards in retirement. This conflict is evident in recent policy reviews of taxation, public spending and pension policy. This article explores the development of this conflict and how it manifests in proposals for reform. We argue that the conflation of welfare and taxation goals increasingly creates a dual welfare state that promotes private provision at the expense of both equity and efficiency.

In practice, however, most European states have been far more successful in what might broadly be called negative activation (less regulation, restrictions on passive benefits and targeted help for high-risk groups), than in investment to enhance the knowledge base and improve mobility.

The aim of this paper is to establish a relationship between the idea of an unconditional basic income and republican thought in general and the Swiss republican tradition in particular. I argue that Swiss republicanism bears a development potential that may provide a normative foundation for the introduction of an unconditional basic income.
Basic income can be justified on grounds of the conception of modern republicanism and its underlying ideal of freedom as non-domination. The Swiss republican tradition shows considerable affinity to this ideal of non-domination; its history can be read as a struggle against domination. In this sense, Swiss republicanism can be linked to the idea of an unconditional basic income. In contrast to other republican traditions in Europe, Swiss republicanism was able to develop and incorporate individualist values in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. Swiss republicanism still plays an important role in Swiss politics. The thesis that there still exists a relationship between Swiss republicanism and basic income will be corroborated by virtue of two examples: an old Swiss republican communal tradition that is still practised consists of disbursing an income that shows remarkable similarities to an unconditional basic income grant. Further, in contemporary Swiss social policy, the first pillar of the Swiss pension system bears considerable resemblance to the basic income idea. On the level of welfare regime research, one can even speak of a soft guarantism that prevails in Swiss social policy.
In Switzerland, a public discourse about the idea of an unconditional basic income has not yet developed. However, in order to inspire discourse, the link to Swiss republicanism could be emphasised. The pathway to the introduction of an unconditional basic income has begun in Swiss traditions already centuries ago. The prospect of further good development in the sense of freedom as nondomination in Switzerland should tie in with Switzerland's own past and tradition.",,Why Switzerland?

-27.557547,-1.5696445,4,"INTRODUCTIONMuhammad Yunus has spent a lifetime working to help the poor. He is the founding father of microfinance and has been compared to Mahatma Gandhi and Bill Gates. Decades before micro lending was popular among development economists, Yunus began making small, interest-free loans to poor rural women in Bangladesh. He believed that what keeps the poor poor isn't a lack of skill or education or work ethic, but merely access to financial intermediation. In 2006 Yunus and Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize for the success of this philosophy, and despite its criticisms and recent controversies microfinance remains a trusted method of bottom-up poverty alleviation.In recent years Dr. Yunus has moved beyond just lending to the poor; his new goal is to eliminate poverty entirely, and his method is to spread the practice of   business, a self-sustaining, zero-loss, zero-dividend   model that applies not only to microfinance but to any good or service provided to the poor. Eschewing traditional for-profit and non-profit models, Building Social Business explains how to create a self-sufficient   that serves humanity's most pressing needs.The book is written for the layperson and shows a gifted communicator at work, simultaneously informing, entertaining, and instructing. Chapters 3 and 5 offer a step -bystep game plan for a socially-minded entrepreneur to start his or her own   business. Build a   around something you're passionate about, Yunus encourages, but tackle an obtainable goal. Look at emulating successful projects in new markets, or find a way to apply your for-profit career skills to   business. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, Yunus encourages luring the most creative, determined workers with competitive salaries and benefits; if the financial rewards are no different, Yunus believes most people will take the job that works to solve   problems. The author also lays out the legal and financial framework for   businesses. Because they aren't recognized as a separate   category,     founders must choose between nonprofit status, which offers tax exemptions in most nations but is strictly regulated, or for-profit status. Yunus waits with eager determination for governments to organize new categories for   businesses.Though primarily a call to action, Building Social Business also advances a strong normative stance against profit and ascribes an overly narrow role to entrepreneurship in improving human conditions. As this review will show, neither argument rests on sound theoretical foundations, and supporting evidence for his arguments is sorely lacking. It will take many more years for   businesses to prove long-term success at solving   problems.Much of Building Social Business repeats the ideas in his 2008 book, Creating a World Without Poverty, which in turn expanded on his 2006 Nobel lecture. In this earlier book, Yunus defines a social business and describes what he sees as the first example of it, Grameen Danone, a joint venture between Grameen Bank and the French yogurt company Groupe Danone. What distinguishes Building Social Business is the step-bystep guideline for entrepreneurs to create their own   businesses, as well as its report on two more years of Grameen Bank's joint venture   businesses; five of the nine chapters, in fact, are descriptions of Grameen' s current and impending     partnerships.As described in the first chapter, a     is one whose goal is to solve a   problem - to alleviate poverty or malnutrition, deliver sanitary water to rural villages, or provide some other service (affordable clothing, education, electricity, healthcare) that would otherwise be unavailable. Essentially, a     seeks to correct a market failure - through private, philanthropic enterprise rather than government intervention.

The results show that the treatment group, compared to the control group, reported higher life satisfaction, better health, less mental distress and depression, stronger cognitive capabilities regarding memory, and ability to learn new things and concentrate.

Comrnunitarian scholar, Lawrence Mead, argues that such policies are ethically justified because they demand 'civic equality' of unemployed citizens. This paper contends that the coercive dimension of work-for-welfare has the potential to   reinforce public perceptions that unemployed citizens are morally inferior, which itself reinforces the social stigma of being unemployed. Based on this interpretation, the concept of civic equality underpinning work-for-welfare is inconsistent with a belief in the dignity of the individual. One could argue that this belief is an important prerequisite for designing unemployment and employment policies that take seriously the notion of civic equality. To support this paper's argument, it will briefly discuss the philosophy and practice of a Queensland-based employment agency that begins from this standpoint.",,Work for Welfare and Civic Equality,https://openalex.org/W1811441929
44.068382,-33.652866,3,"Abstract Degrowth has become a recognised paradigm for identifying and critiquing systemic unsustainability rooted in the capitalist, growth-compelled economy. Increasingly, degrowth is discussed in relation to specific economic sectors such as the agri-food system. This paper builds on the foundational work of Gerber (2020) and Nelson and Edwards (2021). While both publications take a rather specific analytical or disciplinary focus—the former specifically connects critical agrarian studies and degrowth, the latter explores the contributions of the recent volume ‘Food for degrowth’—this paper takes stock of the emerging body of literature on degrowth and agri-food systems more broadly. It proposes research avenues that deepen, expand and diversify degrowth research on agri-food systems in four areas: (i) degrowth conceptualisations; (ii) theorisation of transformations towards sustainability; (iii) the political economy of degrowth agri-food systems; and (iv) rurality and degrowth. Together, these avenues devote due attention to a variety of agents (ranging from translocal networks to non-humans), spaces (e.g. the rural), theories (e.g. sustainability transitions and transformations towards sustainability) and policies (of the agricultural sector and beyond) that thus far have received limited attention within the degrowth literature. The critical social science perspective on degrowth agri-food systems, which is advanced in this paper, illuminates that the present unsustainability and injustice of hegemonic agri-food systems are not merely a problem of that sector alone, but rather are ingrained in the social imaginaries of how economies and societies should work as well as in the political–economic structures that uphold and reproduce these imaginaries.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01276-y,Degrowth and agri-food systems: a research agenda for the critical social sciences,https://openalex.org/W4315783807

Using the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 8 in 2016, which has an item asking whether to support UBI and the 21-item measure of human values that is based on the Schwartz theory of basic human values, the results show that individual universalism that is a self-transcendence value is positively and significantly associated with support for UBI, while the other self-transcendence value, benevolence, has a negative relationship with that; the two self-enhancement values, power and achievement, are positively linked to support for UBI. Additionally, in advanced welfare states, people who are more inclined towards individual universalism are more likely to support UBI; by contrast, in underdeveloped welfare states, this relationship is not apparent.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0010,Basic Human Values and Attitudes Towards a Universal Basic Income in Europe,https://openalex.org/W3010725976

Were that penny to be paid individually, universally, and unconditionally, the answer would be ‘yes’, following the definition of Basic Income given by some of its leading advocates, be it organisations like the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) or prominent scholars such as Philippe Van Parijs. Some might be puzzled as to how this could be ‘a capitalist road to communism’, or give us ‘freedom as the power to say no’, both of which have been advocated by prominent researchers. The purpose of this paper is not to argue for or against their definition, but rather to situate it historiographically, enabling fruitful discussion. The paper will show how there was a widely shared assumption in the 1970s and 80s, at the early stages of both academic articulations and public discussion, that Basic Income comes with some notion of a threshold or level to be taken as a minimum or as adequate. The paper goes on to outline three issues that arise once the concept of a threshold is dropped from the definition. Examined in addition are five justifications for doing so. Much like any other idea, the concept of Basic Income is a social construct. By situating it here within a historical perspective, we wish to facilitate academic discussion regarding both the achievements and erasures that have occurred as a consequence of the concept’s academic refinement—refinement that is in itself majorly indebted to BIEN and Van Parijs.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0037,Is a Penny a Month a Basic Income?

These proposals are the focus of the paper because the had there potential to become official policy. We also investigate the impact of three alternative proposals: 1) A change in the cut-off from 16 to 30 hours; 2) a guaranteed income equivalent to 100% of the MBM; 3) A 3$/hour conditional wage subsidy. To do this, we first estimate a structural labour supply model using the existing tax code and predict the labour supply of a representative sample of individuals based upon the parameter estimates of the model. Simulations show that the original proposal would have strong negative impacts on participation rates of low-earners and that its cost would exceed $ 2 billion. Changing the cut-off is predicted to little impact beyond those of the the original proposals. Providing a guaranteed income equivalent to 100% of the MBM, on the other hand, would have a huge impact.

-17.597136,-19.253319,0,"For many years there has been interest in replacing the existing complex transfer system in the United States with a nationwide negative income tax (NIT) program.' The feasibility and desirability of an NIT, however, depend on its effects on aggregate labor supply (and its cost). Interest in predicting these aggregate effects has motivated considerable empirical research on labor supply. The first studies used existing data, usually cross-sectional, to estimate the parameters of labor supply functions.2 Unfortunately, the range of estimates in these studies is disturbingly large and of limited usefulness to policymakers.3 Consequently, a new approach to labor supply research has been followed social experimentation.4 Several experiments have been funded by the federal government to test the effects of alternative NIT programs on labor supply. The first experiment, the New Jersey Experiment, was conducted in New Jersey and Pennsylvania from 1968 to 1972.5 Other experiments have taken place in Gary, Indiana from 1970 to 1974, and in rural areas of Iowa and North Carolina from 1969 to 1973. The largest and most comprehensive of these experiments began in 1971 in Seattle, Washington and Denver, Colorado and is still taking place. In principle, a controlled experiment affords the opportunity to overcome most of the problems inherent in nonexperimental research, because in an experiment, the budget constraints of individuals are exogenously shifted in a measurable way. In practice, however, the experiments have been beset with their own unique set of econometric problems. These problems include the nonrandom assignment of experimental treatment, small samples, truncation of response, limited duration, participation in other welfare programs both before and during the experiment by sample members, and the selection of nonrepresentative samples.6 In this paper, a methodology is presented that attempts to deal with these problems.

On the one hand, paid work is considered the only way to secure general welfare. On the other hand, the Jobs Strategy urged by the OECD as the only possible model for achieving welfare is questioned and challenged through the idea of basic income. While basic income is frequently discussed within other disciplines, it is scarcely raised within occupational science, despite its obvious relevance. In this article, the significance of paid work and the possible consequences of introducing basic income are raised. Paid work may have healthy effects, but for many people worldwide dependence on paid work for basic security implies unhealthy, hazardous, and unsecure circumstances. Basic income may have a substantial impact on people’s occupational patterns as well as their experiences of occupational meaning. Three underlying rationales for introducing basic income can be traced: i) abolish a bureaucratic payment transfer system and maintain consumption, ii) diminish poverty and enhance a self-determined life, and iii) deepen democratization. These three rationales are discussed through the lens of Arendt’s vita activa: labor, work and action. Rationales underlying claims for basic income have substantially different underlying ideologies and are therefore important to scrutinize.

One problem with a stable basic income across life is that it seems unfair to shorter-lived persons, who are worst-off due to premature death and receive less over their whole lives. Basic capital solves this problem by providing a one-off grant to the young, but I argue that it mistreats long-lived persons, as it does not guarantee their real freedom across life. There is a dilemma between these proposals regarding their respective unfairness to the short- and long-lived.

This solution is compatible with constant income benefits across life, and it offers a fair answer to the problem of unequal longevity, a widely neglected but essential challenge in debates about basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0007,Basic Income and Unequal Longevity,https://openalex.org/W4206946606

If implemented correctly, UBI can add a powerful tool to the Federal Reserve toolkit. UBI can be used to reintroduce inflation to the countries which suffer long-lasting deflationary environment. UBI has the potential to decrease the wealth disparity, decrease the national debt, increase productivity, and increase comparative advantage of the economy.

Maslow, D. McClelland, and others. UBI is a guaranteed minimum, which the state pays to every citizen, regardless of his contribution to the economy. It has been found that the idea of UBI has a long history, but its academic research began only in the second half of the 20th century due to the topic’s potential in reforming the social protection systems of developed countries. The purpose of the article is to assess the satisfaction of human needs as a result of the introduction of UBI in the context of various socio-economic systems (capitalism, socialism, socialism with Chinese characteristics, and communism). During the research, general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction were used. The content of motivation theories as a whole is highlighted and their evolution is briefly outlined. It is determined that the basic income should ensure the satisfaction of the fundamental needs of the first and second levels and contribute to increasing the level of the individual’s needs. It is shown that the implementation of the UBI in socio-economic systems built on the foundations of various ideologies is most likely to lead to positive consequences, despite the existing limitations. It is concluded that the main result of USI’s application will be the weakening of competition for resources and the formation of potential for the individual’s self-development, which would contribute to the growth of human capital. At the same time, it is emphasized that it is not impossible to solve, with the help of basic income the fundamental problems of inequality, which is characteristic of both developing and developed countries, and which causes competition. Through further research, it will be possible to develop more effective and balanced approaches to the use of basic income in economic systems, taking into account the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.",https://doi.org/10.15407/etet2023.02.105,The impact of unconditional basic income on the satisfaction of basic needs in the context of different socio-economic systems: advantages and limitations,https://openalex.org/W4385077955

This restriction is a drawback of these analyses and of the standard economic labor supply model itself. If one wants to understand the potential effects of basic income on individual and social welfare, one should not restrict observation to the pecuniary uses of time. The objective of this contribution is to rethink the meaning of work usually applied in economic models, based on contributions of other social scientists. This reassessment is undertaken through the development of a microeconomic model, which discusses the effects of basic income on time use and interprets work not just as a source of income, but also of non-pecuniary benefits.

This book explains how these changes would benefit a wide variety of social groups, leading to a greater redistribution of income. At the same time, it also raises the question of whether a single reform can meet the very different objectives of different supporters. The author reviews different areas of public economics in which there has been active research in recent years- namely the theory of optimum taxation, public choice theory, general equilibrium analysis of incidence, numerical tax- benefit modelling, and econometric studies of work incentives-and asks how these contribute to our understanding of this particular policy reform.

Developments in social security outlays and recipient numbers over the last two decades are compared with those occurring since 1983, in order that the nature and impact of recent policies introduced to increase targeting can be identified. The analysis indicates that increases in recipient numbers have been the dominant factor underlying the past growth in social security expenditure. The distinction between selectivity and targeting of income support provisions is then explained with reference to the concepts of eligibility and entitlement. A framework is developed to illustrate how recent policies have restrained the growth in social security recipient numbers by policies which have increased income support targeting. These moves have not always produced a consistently more selective system of income support, an issue which is explored with the use of an index of the degree of selectivity of social security expenditures developed specifically for this purpose.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400018900,Selectivity and Targeting in Income Support: The Australian Experience,https://openalex.org/W3124443986

A recent narrative, endorsed by prominent tech-billionaires, says we face mass unemployment, and we need a basic income. In contrast, this article shows why the law can achieve full employment with fair incomes, and holidays with pay. Universal human rights, including the right to ‘share in scientific advancement and its benefits’, set the proper guiding principles. Three distinct views of the causes of unemployment are that it is a ‘natural’ phenomenon, that technology may propel it, or that it is social and legal choice: to let capital owners restrict investment in jobs. Only the third view has any credible evidence to support it. Technology may create redundancies, but unemployment is an entirely social phenomenon. After World War Two, 42% of UK jobs were redundant but social policy maintained full employment, and it can be done again. This said, transition to new technology, when markets are left alone, can be exceedingly slow: a staggering 88% of American horses lost their jobs after the Model T Ford, but only over 45 years. Taking lessons from history, it is clear that unemployment is driven by inequality of wealth and of votes in the economy.

In Friedman’s scheme, individuals earning an income beneath a certain threshold receive the difference between their income and that threshold rather than paying taxes. A basic income guarantee (BIG) differs only in that it pays an amount equal to that threshold to everyone regardless of income up front, balancing the outlay through taxes afterwards. Charles Murray (2006, 2008) has defended it as a potential compromise between libertarians and liberals as a measure replacing the welfare state. Hayek (1960: 376), while lambasting proposals to engineer the overall pattern of income distribution, defends the idea of a minimum income floor, one of the primary aims of basic income advocates.

Our empirical strategy leverages quasi-random assignment of veterans claiming mental disorder disability to examiners who vary in their assessing tendencies.

Despite facing virtually no direct monetary costs, healthcare utilization increases by 2.5% over the first five years, with greater engagement in preventive care and improved medication adherence. This demand response is in part explained by the ability to overcome indirect costs of accessing care (""ordeals""). Additionally, VA-conducted surveys suggest that transfers improve communication and trust between veterans and VA clinicians, leading to greater overall satisfaction.

It is a partial, not a full, basic income, as it is not sufficient for basic needs. But like other basic income schemes, it is universal and detached from any work requirement. A basic income funded in this way is a natural resource dividend.

This book asks how this model might be replicated in other contexts, and with other resources.

Instead of following the traditional continuous approach (Hausman, Labour supply, Aaron and Pechman (eds.), How Taxes Affect Economic Behaviour, The Brooking Institution, Washington, DC, 1981; Econometrica, 53: 1255–1282, 1985; Taxes and labour supply, Auerbach and Feldstein, (eds.), Handbook of Public Economics, North-Holland, Amsterdam, vol. 1, 1979), we estimate the direct utility function employing the methodology proposed by Aaberge et al. (Scand. J. Econ., 97: 635–659, 1995) and Van Soest (J. Hum. Resour., 30: 63–88, 1995).

The source of our data is a sample of Spanish individuals in the 1995 wave of the EC Household Panel.

We draw on Hirschman’s exit, voice and loyalty framework to argue that a basic income can offer a structural foundation for a radical shift towards more equitable family relations. This is because a basic income can support couples through economic uncertainty and reduce women’s structural vulnerability to economic dependency within marriages that strips them of exit and voice. We build our case on novel data from an understudied social experiment from the late 1970s called the Manitoba Basic Income Experiment, or Mincome. Using difference-in-difference regression with individual fixed-effects, we analyze three types of family outcomes: separation, bargaining power and marital conflict. We find that during Mincome unhappy couples became more likely to consider separation, but that separation overall did not increase. We also find that Mincome reduced marital conflict associated with financial stressors and that some measures of wives’ bargaining power increased. Taken together, our results speak in favor of the view that a basic income has the potential to foster more equitable family lives.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaa050,"Exit, voice and loyalty in the family: findings from a basic income experiment",https://openalex.org/W3120501030

Moreover, persistent philosophical doubts – including objections to the alleged “positive” character of economic rights, questions about the purported interdependence and indivisibility of human rights, worries about the specificity of the obligations arising in connection with economic rights, and fears about the illimitable character of those obligations – render economic rights conceptually wobbly and politically precarious. It is true that theorists of social justice generally eschew rights-based approaches, though activists and advocates increasingly adopt the language of human rights in making their demands.

Economists frequently describe efficiency and equality as two separate, yet potentially conflicting, objectives. While in some circumstances the achievement of one of these objectives might preclude attaining the other, the evidence suggests that the post-war British economy has suffered a decline in relative efficiency with no progress towards greater equality. Faster growth rates, full employment and higher living standards are most likely to occur as a result of increased and sustained capital formation. The currently dominant economic philosophy of monetarism seeks to satisfy this requirement by redistributing income towards capitalists in the hope that they will then find investment attractive. The British left urgently requires an alternative strategy that generates new investment, while simultaneously establishing an ongoing egalitarian trend. As the political conditions for a revolutionary transformation of society are unlikely to prevail in the foreseeable future, socialist governments need to fulfil three crucial economic objectives:- (i) to restore full employment while maintaining approximate price stability, (ii) to accelerate the rate of capital accumulation in order to boost future increases in living standards, (iii) to redistribute income and wealth in the direction of greater equality without imperilling future economic growth.",https://doi.org/10.1332/030557385782595945,The Political Economy of Employee Investment Funds,https://openalex.org/W1984111982

For qualitative analysis of these letters, codes derived deductively from concepts that belong to flourishing on the basis of three dimensions of well-being and inductively on the basis of the letter content. Then, a comparative analysis of codes between letters of men and women was presented. Results revealed gender commonalities especially in emotional and psychological well-being. Differences concerned the level of subjectivity with which the UBI scenario was perceived: Whereas women experienced the support of UBI on a very personal level, men referred comparably more to others, expressing their desire of to spend more time with their family in the alternate UBI future.

The normative literature on basic income has developed numerous arguments in support of basic income as an inextricable component of a just social order, but there exists little analysis about basic income within a jurisprudential or philosophical rights perspective. In our view, strong reasons of either a principled or a pragmatic nature in support of instituting a basic income scheme nevertheless often fall short of ascribing to basic income a distinctive Hohfeldian rights status. This article aims to partially redress this gap by examining two sets of questions. First, what are the implications – ethical and practical – of adopting basic income as a legal right as opposed to a mere policy? Second, we also enquire whether there should be such a right: what, if anything, is the ethical foundation that warrants granting basic income a distinctive legal rights status? This article suggests that any such foundation must be grounded in comparative evaluation and discusses several comparative strategies available to basic income advocates.

However, by the end of the twentieth century, as a result of the changing family reforms and labour market patterns, leave arrangements had become a major policy issue with debates concentrating on entitlement, length of leave, and income support. This chapter discusses the development of leave policies, specifically parental leave in the Netherlands. This development has involved different interpretations of the purpose of leave and the divisions of responsibilities between the government, parents, and social partners. Starting from the view point in which parental leave was seen as a way to facilitate part-time employment, the Parental Leave Act provided a basic entitlement to take part-time, unpaid leave for a short period of time. It was left to the social partners to supplement this minimum. However, over time, public responsibility for leave has increased. This was evident not only in the increasing number of leave policies, but in the growing public involvement in the provision of income support as well. During this process, the interpretation of parental leave appeared to have changed from a labour market instrument into a more complex instrument intended to facilitate parenthood and the well-being of children.",https://doi.org/10.1332/policypress/9781847420671.003.0011,The Netherlands: bridging labour and care,https://openalex.org/W2490551078

While high income countries can claw back the transfer to the higher income group through a progressive income tax, this is not possible in developing countries where most people operate in the informal sector. This note looks at an alternative to either narrow targeting or UBI. It uses household survey data from 52 low and middle-income countries to compare the poverty impact of a UBI to a transfer that is gradually reduced as estimated consumption increases. The taper can be set at different rates and can lead to zero transfers to households above a chosen threshold.

Even with simplifying assumptions, these figures are several times more accurate than many common but exaggerated estimates. Key findings of this study include the following. The net cost — the real cost — of this UBI scheme is $539 billion per year: about one-sixth its often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful gross cost of about $3.415 trillion.

Rather, society should certainly respect the “social freedom” of the basic rights, and secure some kind of efficient equal freedom of choice in domains of choice which are necessarily non-identical. The various ways of specifying this principle lead to the same distributive structure of ELIE – equal labour income equalization –, which also amounts to an equal tax credit (or basic income) financed by an equal labour of all – or by a flat tax exempting overtime labour –; to each individual yielding to each other the proceeds of the same labour; and to a number of other highly meaningful properties. This scheme is incentive-compatible, implies a minimum income, and satisfies realistic no-envy. It applies to multidimensional labour and extends to situations of unemployment.

From the perspective of individual value, it was also found that the perception of the future vision of a society reshaped by BI also significantly influences public attitudes toward the policy.

Moreover, in organizational terms, it is much easier to directly transfer an equal sum of money to everyone, especially in conditions of self-isolation.

This paper suggests two policy models of basic income that can be applied to Korea. The first model, the Basic Income Model I, combines basic income with national land holding tax. The Basic Income Model Ⅱ has a plan to procure the necessary revenue from land tax, environmental tax, and citizen income tax. If a basic income is introduced in Korea in the future, the actual policy should lie somewhere between Model Ⅰ and Model II. BR Our simulation results show that under Model Ⅰ, where the amount of annual basic income per person will range from 300,000 Won to 2,300,000 Won, 97% of the total households will become net beneficiaries of the policy. In contrast, the annual basic income will rise to 3,600,000 Won per capita with Model II, making 83% of the total households net beneficiaries. As the dividend per capita is greater in Model Ⅱ, the redistributive effect of income, which is shown in terms of the Gini-coefficient improvement, is much larger in Model Ⅱ than in Model I. Yet, because Model Ⅱ requires 185 trillion Won for its implementation, it seems politically less feasible to apply the Model II to the current Korean society.BR Even with the implementation of Model I, the softer model, we expect the following changes to take place in Korea. First, the propensity to seek rents will be reduced after the imposition of national land tax on all land owners. Second, inequality in land ownership will be mitigated and Chaebols and large enterprises will focus more on productive investments rather than on land speculation.

We focus on a proposal by the European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) for an EU Framework Directive on Minimum Income Protection, in order to examine three aspects of that policy conundrum: (1) the instrumental relevance of minimum income protection; (2) the unequal burden of the redistributive effort that would be required across the EU if the Union were to impose hic et nunc a minimum income guarantee of 60% or 40% of the median national income in all Member States; and (3) the impact on dependency traps, under the same hypothesis.

Under our perspective, in the post-industrialised economies of all major developed countries, paid work cannot be seen anymore as an instrument of self-determination (Marx, 1844) but becomes the main generator of exploitation and poverty.

In particular, building on empirical evidence, we argue that loss aversion and hedonic adaptation are culturally-determined and country-specific aptitudes and that they may help explaining why workers, either employed or unemployed, ask for job protection and are willing to pay the cost of it. The main conclusion of our analysis is that, for poorly educated workers sharing a fatalist view of life, job protection can be more effective than public social expenditure.

The proposal intended to be primarily a platform for useful discussion, in order to let civil society and policy makers evaluate, from a cultural, political as well as institutional perspective, the opportunity of establishing a “selective universalism” measure to fight poverty and social exclusion. Then, the paper highlights the organizational and implementation details, which are necessarily designed according to the specificity of the Lombardy welfare regime, but are surely transferrable to other models of local welfare. Above all, it discusses the rationale of the proposal, starting from the idea that the fight against poverty is “constituent”, in the true meaning of the word, as it forms not only the model of the welfare state but also of the society itself. The Capability Income invites to give priority on the political agenda to the fight to poverty and social exclusion and to embrace an “active inclusion” strategy. It states the right to be supported against the risk of poverty and social exclusion as a real and true right of citizenship, not subjected either to political will or to a compassionate and stigmatizing reading of the poor. Then, it identifies the most appropriate response to poverty in an “enabling” approach, which intervenes on the conditions that prevent the fulfilment of life. It provides for in cash and, above all, in kind benefits, so as to guarantee anyone the opportunity to enjoy “substantial freedom”, as suggested by the “capability approach”. Indeed, the lack of income is just a part of poverty, being the capability for agency the main skill to master one’s own life. Accordingly, the Capability income aims at detecting and removing the causes of poverty and their reproduction across generations through a combined intervention of welfare, welfare to work and learnfare, in which centrality is given to social inclusion alongside labour market activation and in which education, from the early childhood, vocational training and lifelong learning are promoted as an opportunity for empowerment and not only for employability. The paper addresses these questions and also discusses the implications of a political approach which recognizes that employment is not always sufficient to protect against poverty and which states that achievement of wealth and autonomy requires a merging of capabilities and rights; that is to say of individual responsibility and collective solidarity.",,Capability Income: A policy proposal in the fight against poverty and social exclusion,https://openalex.org/W2551893715

Yet, though the level of state support in unemployment is the most crucial determinant of economic strain, there has been little research on the impact of welfare benefit regime on mental well-being among the unemployed. In this paper we compare the impact of benefit regime by comparing the unemployed in Britain, Ireland and Sweden. We find that the type of benefit received is an important determinant of mental distress with income replacement benefits being more beneficial than flat rate benefits. Results also show that different systems differentially impact on different groups with income replacement benefits tending to maintain pre-unemployment differences in distress and flat rate benefits equalising these differences.

The positive and negative consequences of using transitional UBI forms were revealed: “social dividends”, guaranteed minimum income, “negative income tax”, support for the most vulnerable groups of the population, cash payments during the pandemic period. It is concluded that the use of the UBI will contribute to the solution of a number of significant social problems in modern societies.

The results suggest that while a higher UBI would increase consumption, it would likely be done responsibly. People with low incomes showed restraint in all categories. The qualitative analysis captures some of the complexities of people’s socioeconomic circumstances that support the notion of responsible consumption.

It shows that interest in the proposal has been greatest at times of pessimism about the future of the labour market, though concerns about the ethics and affordability of unconditional payments have always been difficult to shake.

These functions create wealth for the participants, and they provide unique advantages unavailable in traditional financial systems.

5.0742884,16.492687,1,"In recent years, the welfare state has found itself unable to combat issues such as unemployment and poverty, forcing an ever-increasing share of the population to face an increasingly precarious existence. In light of this situation, a growing number of activists and academics have begun to embrace a new means for combating such issues, basic income. Basic income represents a radical departure from the current means of organizing welfare benefits, as an unconditional income granted to individuals without regard for means, age, or employment status. This thesis seeks to examine the potential effects of basic income with specific reference to the concept of social exclusion. 

In order to investigate the potential effects of basic income upon social exclusion, traditional quantitative or qualitative methods are not appropriate; therefore this thesis performs a conceptual analysis in relation to the concepts of basic income and social exclusion. To perform a conceptual analysis, a thorough understanding of each concept is first required. Basic income’s advocates justify the idea in many ways, ranging from arguments relating to its ability to provide true freedom to all to arguments viewing basic income as a means of challenging capitalism. Nonetheless, its critics remain, specifically in reference to its unconditional nature. Social exclusion, meanwhile, relates to the involuntary ability of an individual to participate in normal societal activities. Individuals become socially excluded through competition for resources and status within society, with the labor process playing the largest role in the creation of social exclusion.

The analysis of this thesis suggests that basic income has the ability to create a more inclusive society, in which fewer individuals suffer from social exclusion. Specifically, it appears to have considerable influence upon the labor process within society, and more broadly, the entire notion of work. Nevertheless, basic income does not seem to fundamentally alter the mechanisms that create social exclusion, leaving a small share of the population excluded even with a basic income. However, this thesis concludes by arguing that basic income appears to fulfill many of the goals of its advocates, and has the ability to combat social exclusion more effectively than current welfare policies.",,Can Basic Income Combat Social Exclusion?

This paper examines the implications of moving to a system where benefits are universal and the marginal tax rate schedule is simplified to a constant rate, refered to as a basic income — flat tax system. The Melbourne Institute Tax Transfer Simulator(MITTS), a behavioural micro-simulation model of the Australian tax-transfer system is used to examine the distributional,labour supply and government expenditure effects of moving to a basic income—flat tax system. Providing basic income levels that coincide with current benefit rates is costly, with a marginal tax rate of over fifty percent required for revenue neutrality. Such a system, while equitable, is found to reduce labour supply. If a version to inequality is high, this system is found to be socialy optimal, even after reductions in labour supply. Decreases in the marginal tax rate improve work incentives and increase the supply of labour, but increase inequality and impose a significant cost burden on government. A decline in the level of basic income of at least half is required to fund a reduction in the marginal tax rate to thirty percent. While the distortions to behaviour are minimal with this final system, it is extremely inequitable and social welfare reducing, even after a counting for changes in labour supply.",,Moves to a basic income-flat tax system in Australia: implications for the distribution of income and supply of labour,https://openalex.org/W1507815671

Extant empirical studies suggest that this degree of reduction is unlikely to be achieved solely through efforts to decouple GDP growth from environmental impact, even under highly optimistic conditions.

Using the ontological frameworks proposed by John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx as terms of comparison, the first part of the chapter shows that Emile Durkheim's theory of social justice offers a theorisation of society, individual, and market from which an adequate justification of the right to minimum income can be derived. In line with Durkheim's theory of social justice, it is argued that each individual has the right to personal development which can be performed while carrying out a social function in society, such as paid employment, providing care to dependent family members, unpaid work in social economy organisations, and improving human capital through education or training. Securing this right means that social actors and institutions must: meet the basic consumption needs of every individual; remove any forms of constraints on the individual's choices on the best way to exploit their talents; provide opportunities for the individual to exploit their talents; and enforce through the use of restitutive sanctions an individual's obligation to exploit their talents to enable personal development of others.

Nevertheless, over the 1990s significant innovations in this field have taken place. The paper aims to contribute to the analysis of recent developments by critically examining the experience of anti‐poverty policies in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. It is argued that the “patchiness” of safety nets in southern Europe is due to a unique set of constraints, the most relevant of which are the role of families and the “softness” of state institutions. A review of national profiles reveals that new policies introduced in all four countries mark progress towards redressing some of the historical imbalances of that welfare model. In particular, fully fledged minimum income schemes now operate in Portugal and in certain Spanish regions, while an experiment involving a number of Italian municipalities is still in progress. In spite of this, the paper concludes that social safety nets in southern Europe remain frail in terms of institutional design as well as political support and legitimacy.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9515.00363,"Mending Nets in the South: Anti‐poverty Policies in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain",https://openalex.org/W2067805391

Basic income theorists say that AI and robots will eliminate jobs and that the introduction of basic income will be inevitable. But the problem is social security. The principle of a 'welfare state' must work in social security. The welfare state is based on mutual aid and social solidarity. It is a system in which citizens put taxes and insurance premiums into the community's piggy bank, and people who need them take them out according to the size they need. The entire nation saves money in piggy banks, but the n received is always a small number. The salary is generous because n is small. I don't take it right away, but I can always go and get help when I'm in danger and a need for social recognition arises. But there are no piggy banks in basic income countries. Everyone shares it as it is. It cannot be more equal than this, but the salary is inevitably low because there are many ns. And there is no social solidarity or mutual aid. The state just plays the role of Robin Hood. The contrast of redistribution varies by income level, and there is no social security or welfare. This is why social security cannot be left to basic income now and in the future. In addition to global economic inequality, socioeconomic polarization is intensifying in Korea, and basic income is drawing attention as an alternative system that can contribute to resolving economic injustice amid concerns over employment loss caused by digital technology innovation.",https://doi.org/10.46751/nplak.2023.19.3.63,Is basic income an alternative to social security?,https://openalex.org/W4386419540

In this paper I first discuss the poverty concept and its implication for social policy strategy. The poverty concept should be but one in a system of concepts that throws light on the whole distribution of income and wealth and how income from labor as well as income from capital is generated. The central concepts in the system are income and economic standard, which I explain in different perspectives on command over resources. The command-over-resources concept is used to get from a narrow concept of material welfare that can be measured in money to a wider concept of welfare that includes the universal common social concerns. I confess to being intrigued by the fact that a list of social concerns can be agreed upon that seems to be relevant across cultures, political systems and times. I suggest that this surmised universality springs from the great “life projects” that all humans face over the life cycle. I then discuss the role of social indicators and social reporting as continuous information on these common concerns in the context of an epistemology of the democratic process.

To prove this thesis, I first examine the process of robotization during past decades and especially during the past few years in order to illustrate the scale of the problem, which is on its earlier stage today, but is expected to change the economic and political reality of all societies in the years to come. After that, I examine two main views about the contradictions and conflicts that robotization brings. Firstly, attention is paid to the vision of techno-optimists, which corresponds mainly to the theories of neoliberalism and neoclassic. After that, the view of techno-pessimists is examined, related mainly to realistic and Marxist tradition in political economy. Several aspects of the contemporary discussion about the overcoming of the contradictions of robotization are addressed – mainly through reduced working hours, unconditional basic income and taxing robots instead of humans.

The first, as found within the ‘neorepublican’ theories of Philip Pettit and Frank Lovett, argues that, in addition to existing regulatory protections, free market exchange backed up with an effective right of exit for employees secured through unconditional basic income policies is sufficient to counter employer domination. The second response, advanced by a number of ‘workplace republicans’, challenges the neorepublican understanding of economic domination and the claim that a right of exit secured through basic income policies can sufficiently check managerial power. Under this alternative perspective, what are required are tight regulation of workplace practices and the institutionalization of worker voice and democratic control within firms. This article explores the neo-republican argument and strategy for limiting employer domination through an effective right of exit. It then moves to question the neo-republican position and to offer an evaluation and defence of some of the strategies recommended by workplace republicans as a means towards institutionalizing employee voice and control within firms.",https://doi.org/10.54648/ijcl2017018,"Non-Domination, Workplace Republicanism, and the Justification of Worker Voice and Control",https://openalex.org/W2751579866

In this paper I argue that key elements of his framework should form part of any progressive justification of BI. Specifically, his linking of the principle of ‘real freedom for all’ with the policy mechanism of the ‘highest sustainable basic income.’ I take issue with Van Parijs’ treatment of compensation for unequal internal endowments based on the criterion of ‘undominated diversity’ and I reject the ‘external resources’ approach to justifying the funding of a substantial BI, including Van Parijs’ ‘jobs as assets’ argument. I introduce the concept of ‘total social productivity’ as a means of understanding the production and reproduction of society in a manner that anchors the justification of BI in a commitment to a ‘deep form of social reciprocity.’ Finally, I suggest that BI be framed as a ‘pragmatic-utopian reform.’",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0022,Real Freedom for All Revisited – Normative Justifications of Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2668403398
29.440622,-4.741157,5,"The article concerns the social theory of an unconditional basic income (a regular payment to each person regardless of their level of need or employment). The article points out that, during the last three years in Russia, the idea of a basic income has been actively discussed. This applies mainly to economists, whereas the author puts the question of a basic income in the context of Western social theory. In a situation of ever-accelerating changes that affect society (from technologicalization and automation to the reduction of social time), the world faces many global challenges. A basic income is one of them. The article highlights the reasons for the actualization of the topic of a universal basic income in contemporary social theory of the last ten years. These include automation, the transformation of the economy leading to changes in the types of employment, experiments on the implementation of a basic income in some countries, and most importantly, the discussion of “bullshitization”, which has happened to many jobs in the framework of contemporary financial capitalism (David Graeber). It reveals the understanding of a basic income by its key proponents and theorists (Srnicek, Williams, Van Parijs, Vanderborght, Ford, Graeber, Standing, and others), as well as the fact that freedom is often called as the main goal of a basic income implementation. The paper demonstrates that, in fact, we are mostly talking about the imperative of freedom, which is not always properly clarified. However, it does not matter how freedom is understood in the works of basic income theorists since it is unlikely to be realized in modern socio-economic conditions, and because current capitalism has mutated so much that it now uses the very fabric of human experience rather than labor as its raw material. In this context, talks about automation is more of a thought experiment, and therefore the discussion should be shifted to another perspective. Despite the fact that, according to the author’s case, a basic income is not entirely impossible in practice (and even perhaps not being desirable), it provides fruitful material for the development of contemporary social theory.",https://doi.org/10.17323/1728-192x-2020-2-198-224,Free Money in a Mousetrap of Surveillance Capitalism: Basic Income and Social Theory,https://openalex.org/W3038795267

This ideal does not seem like it can justify state‐mandated economic redistribution. For if one is externally free just as long as one can choose and act without being constrained by another, then only direct slavery, serfdom, or other systems of overt control seem to threaten external freedom. Yet Kant endows the freedom‐based state with considerable powers of economic redistribution. I argue that recent commentary has misunderstood both Kant's account of why poverty is a form of freedom‐threatening dependence and the extent of the Kantian state's powers for remedying poverty. Criticizing Arthur Ripstein and the Kantianism of the “Toronto‐School,” I argue that the most salient notion of dependence at issue within the Kantian framework is not the direct control of the choice‐making capacities of another but asymmetrical influence in a power relationship.

However, the four sucessive Conservative governments of 1979 to 1997 brought a fundamental change in approach. Rejecting Beveridge’s idea that the state should provide financial assistance ‘from the cradle to the grave’ to those deemed to be in need, reforms were directed towards reducing the role of the state in providing financial support to those in need. This manifested itself in a number of ways. Most obviously, from 1980 benefits were uprated in line with prices rather than with wages, the consequence of which was that benefit levels fell sharply in comparison to the standard of living enjoyed by those not having to resort to state support, e.g. between 1978 and 1987 a married couple’s normal entitlement to supplementary benefit fell from 61% of personal disposable income per capita to 53%. Secondly, increased conditions were imposed on eligibility for entitlement to benefits. Thus, as an example, in 1989 the requirement to be ‘actively seeking work’ was added to that of being ‘available for work’ for those claiming unemployment benefit while, when jobseeker’s allowance replaced unemployment benefit in 1996, a further requirement of needing to agree a ‘jobseeker’s agreement’ was also imposed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-14610-9_14,Reform — Past and Present,https://openalex.org/W2490495449

I argue that in present conditions of high productivity it is more consistent with the liberal tradition to proclaim a right to develop one’s capabilities than a right to work. The steps of my argument are: (1) An important though not the only reason for considering unemployment unjust has been what I call the Promethean idea of society.

-17.10642,-6.952762,5,"Abstract The twin predicaments of German labour market performance and welfare state performance triggered an ongoing debate on reforming the German model. Recently, this debate has yielded an outcome in the form of the so-called Hartz laws, a bundle of labour market policies aimed at the reduction of unemployment and the decrease of non-wage labour costs. The Hartz reforms have played a prominent role in the public discussion, but are they really a watershed as both optimists and pessimists claim? In this article we investigate in what sense the Hartz reforms mark a substantive political change and how they are related to similar processes in other countries. To characterise the policy output we discuss three views of policy reform: reform as a process of policy-learning, reform as a process of competitive realignment and reform as a process of reinforcing path dependence. We show which of the three paradigms accounts for which part of the political result. We find evidence for both policy diffusion and retrenchment, but it is too early to speak of a change of regime. Rather, both the changes thus far and the blocked proposals follow a traditional German logic of strong institutional resistance. Notes 1. The German PES was called the Federal Institute for Employment (Bundesanstalt für Arbeit) but was renamed the Federal Agency for Employment (Bundesagentur für Arbeit) as part of the Hartz reforms. 2. For a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the road from the Hartz Commission's proposal to its actual implementation, see Jann and Schmid (2004 Jann, Werner and Günther, Schmid, eds. 2004. Eins zu eins?: Eine Zwischenbilanz der Hartz-Reformen am Arbeitsmarkt, Berlin: edition sigma. [Google Scholar]). 3. The official title for the acts is the First (Second, etc.) Act for Modern Services on the Labour Market (Erstes [Zweites, etc.] Gesetz für moderne Dienstleistungen am Arbeitsmarkt). 4. As a matter of fact, 'Hartz IV', the colloquial term for this part of the reform, was selected as the 'Word of the Year 2004' by the Society for German Language (Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache) because it was said to be most suitable for characterising public opinion during the past year. 5. As an unintended consequence of this reform, the number of officially registered jobseekers crossed the five million mark in January 2005 for the first time since World War II. 6. For the first two years of the reform, a supplement is paid to jobseekers moving from unemployment assistance to Unemployment Benefit II, in order to guarantee a smooth transition rather than a radical change for existing benefit recipients. 7. Among economists the high persistence of European unemployment has frequently been related to institutions in the labour market and the welfare state (e.g. Siebert 1997 Siebert, Horst. 1997. Labor Market Rigidities: At the Root of Unemployment in Europe. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11(3): 37–54. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). 8. As a matter of fact, some of the organisers tried to link these demonstrations to the tradition of the so-called Leipziger Montagsdemonstrationen (Leipzig Monday Demonstrations), political protest rallies that ultimately toppled the former East German government in 1989. 9. Total expenditure for labour market policy was about €65 billion in comparison with a 'social budget' of €540 billion in 2001 (BMGS 2001 BMGS. 2001. ""Sozialbericht 2001"". In Bundesministerium für Gesundheit und Soziale Sicherheit Berlin [Google Scholar]). 10. To complicate issues further, 69 municipalities were given the option to take over all Unemployment Benefit II recipients. Thus, in these 69 municipalities the conservative opposition's concept is tested and will be evaluated against the results of the consortia. This could prove to be one of the few cases of competitive federalism in Germany. 11.

There is a huge literature including empirical and theoretical studies on its efficiency and success on poverty alleviation. Despite this worldwide popularity, in a growing number of recent studies microfinance has been subjected to severe criticisms in that it has almost no success in solving inequality and redistribution problems deeply rooted in poverty. It has been accused of transforming the poor into the entrepreneur-client, being a poverty trap for the poor, reproducing the poverty cycle recursively and most crucially serving for neoliberalism. The first part of this study is allotted to these criticisms on microfinance policies. The main cause for poverty is lack of sustainable income. To generate this income for the poor to get out of poverty, there is one other alternative that has started to gain more interest in poverty reduction circle namely basic income. Basic income departs significantly from the microfinance model in that it is an income-generation suggestion based on the premise that the fight against poverty should be carried out within the context of social rights and inequality.

Both economic and sociological theory suggest that the negative tax benefits may, in the short run, increase the proportions reporting themselves in ill health and utilizing care, and, in the long run, reduce these figures. However, the empirical literature suggests the effects may be modest, vary by family members, and be swamped by other variables. Data are presented for two or three points in time (depending on the family member) over the three year duration of the experiments and no effects of any kind are observed. The results give credence to suggestions that health and health care utilization may be more a function of life style or preferences than income. While neither economic nor sociological theory asserts the effects of income are simple, these data suggest its theoretical role is still not well understood. This paper examines the effects of the recently completed New JerseyPennsylvania Negative Income Tax Experiment on health and health care utilization.1 The issue is an important one for two reasons. First, for those family members who are potential or active laborforce participants, the experimental benefits, by lowering the costs of not working and increasing the funds available for health care, may lead individuals to acknowledge health conditions that their need to earn had previously caused them to ignore. Second, the experimental payments may make possible expenditures for health which improve the ability to work or to engage in other, nonwork activities. Thus, the experiment's effects on health and the utilization of health care may have an important bearing on the assessment of the costs and benefits of a negative income tax program.

17.769192,-31.891151,0,"Differently from most European countries and despite the recommendations on the part of the European Commission, Italy still misses a sufficiently systematic and nationwide mechanism of income support. In this paper we explore the feasibility, the desirability and the features of a universal policy of minimum income in Italy. We use a microeconometric model and a social welfare methodology in order to evaluate various alternatives mechanisms. We simulate the effects and the social welfare performance of 30 reforms resulting from six versions of five basic types of income support mechanism: guaranteed minimum income (GMI), universal basic income (UBI), wage subsidy (WS) and two mixed systems: GMI+WS and UBI+WS. As welfare evaluation criteria we adopt the Gini Social Welfare function and the Poverty-Adjusted Gini Social Welfare function. All the reforms are calibrated so as to preserve fiscal neutrality. The simulation adopts a methodology that allows for market equilibrium and ensures a consistent comparative statics interpretation of the results. Universal and non mean-tested transfers (possibly complemented by wage subsidy) emerge as desirable and feasible features of the income support mechanism. In the most realistic scenarios, the social-welfare-optimal policies are an unconditional transfer combined with a wage subsidy (a total benefit amounting to about 70% of the poverty level) or – depending on the social welfare criterion – a more generous pure unconditional transfer amounting to100% of the poverty level. In this exercise the reforms can be financed by proportionally increasing the current marginal tax rates and widening the tax base to include all personal incomes, with top marginal rates close to ones currently applied in the Scandinavian countries. The set of universalistic policies that are preferable to the current system is anyway very large and appears to give the opportunity of selecting a best reform according to many different criteria or constraints.",,Designing a universal income support mechanism for Italy.An exploratory tour,https://openalex.org/W3124050324

In this respect, in every economy, it is necessary to develop an efficient system of welfare and social support in order to empower each individual and help one realize his/her professional and innovative potential regardless of his/her socio-economic status. After all, the successful realization of the economic role of government, as well as the creation of such social policy that would result in greater equality of income distribution, is an essential condition for the stability and efficiency of the economic system, since greater equality is not opposed to greater efficiency criterion and more rapid economic growth. However, in transition countries, due to the prevailing neo-liberal concept of deregulation, liberalization and privatization, the social development component is completely marginalized.

We draw on work conducted in the Joint Learning Initiative on Children and AIDS's Learning Group 1: Strengthening Families, as well as published data and empirical literature to provide the rationale for family strengthening. We close with the following recommendations for strengthening families to ameliorate the effects of HIV and AIDS on children. Firstly, a developmental approach to poverty is an essential feature of responses to protect children affected by HIV and AIDS, necessary to safeguard their human capital. For this reason, access to essential services, such as health and education, as well as basic income security, must be at the heart of national strategic approaches. Secondly, we need to ensure that support garnered for children is directed to families. Unless we adopt a family oriented approach, we will not be in a position to interrupt the cycle of infection, provide treatment to all who need it and enable affected individuals to be cared for by those who love and feel responsible for them. Thirdly, income transfers, in a variety of forms, are desperately needed and positively indicated by available research. Basic economic security will relieve the worst distress experienced by families and enable them to continue to invest in the health care and education of their children. Lastly, interventions are needed to support distressed families and prevent knock-on negative outcomes through programmes such as home visiting, and protection and enhancement of children's potential through early child development efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09540120902923121,Strengthening families to support children affected by HIV and AIDS,https://openalex.org/W2132307643

17.799723,-8.302291,5,"The idea of guaranteed income and the politics of redistribution in modern Britain “The idea of a ‘guaranteed income’ is one of the oldest ideas in the multi-century history of social policy” The post-war model of social security set out to build just such an “income floor”. Both William Beveridge and Clement Attlee, committed to a universal and collective approach to social protection, were strongly influenced by the Minority Report, which came to be viewed as a seminal moment in the history of social policy. In the post-war reforms, this floor was to be delivered by a combination of measures: a much more comprehensive system of collective national insurance, family allowances, full employment (for men) and buoyant wages. There was also the ‘safety net’ of means-tested national assistance, in effect a replacement for the old Poor Law. Although this new social contract with citizens was light years ahead of the patchy and widely hated pre-war model of support, the new reforms were far from free of holes. Many, including most women, were not covered by national insurance, while the benefit levels were lower than even Beveridge's recommended, but mean, subsistence levels. The reformers hoped that with the new national insurance scheme and economic buoyancy, national assistance would be a residual system quickly phased out over time. In the event, it came to play a much-expanded role. By the beginning of the 1960s, these flaws had been exposed by a string of studies revealing that while poverty had been lowered compared with the pre-war era, it had been far from conquered. With the post-war reforms falling well short of the vision of the pioneers, interest in a basic income continued to surface, albeit through a diversity of approaches, terminology (Sloman uses the terms ‘universal basic income’, ‘basic income’ and ‘income floor’ largely interchangeably) and ideological positions. Examples include the 1943 cash payment plan for all those willing to work, promoted by the Liberal party activist Lady Juliet Rhys Williams as an alternative to Beveridge, and a negative income tax (that would top up low incomes through the tax system), advocated by the pro-market economist Milton Friedman. This type of basic income approach was closely considered, but ultimately dropped, by Richard Nixon in the US in the early 1970s. The US debate also influenced the Heath government's brief flirtation with a tax credit scheme, a variant on a negative income tax aimed at topping up low pay through the tax system. “Britain's approach to social protection and the alleviation of poverty since the post-war reforms has been heavily influenced by RML [redistributive market liberalism]” “Despite the waves of interest in an unconditional basic income/income floor, the idea has mostly been dismissed as utopian and too costly” “Most benefit levels are today below those in other comparable rich nations, and in some cases much lower as a ratio of typical earnings than in the 1970s and earlier” “Since 2012, five million sanctions have been issued against benefit claimants, leaving them without income for weeks” “corporate leaders and financial barons … have secured an inflated share of national wealth that is out of proportion to their contribution” “poverty rates … are set to rise still further, with millions living below a ‘national minimum of civilised life’” Following the 2008 global financial crash, there was, for a while, a “turn away from RML”. Labour's post-2010 leader, Ed Miliband, championed a policy of ‘predistribution’, aimed at a more equal distribution of the cake before taxes and benefits, through tighter regulation of business activity, tackling monopoly pricing and the boosting of labour's bargaining power to raise wages. Against this, post-2010 governments adopted an austerity-driven RML. This was accompanied by a mild boost to the National Minimum Wage, but one insufficient to offset the effect of sharp benefit cuts. “an unconditional income floor has … been given a further upsurge in interest as the most effective way of tackling the falling incomes and failing livelihoods arising from the response to coronavirus” “The ‘disincentive to work’ argument has long been used to drive benefit rates down, and is a red herring” Studies have shown that, while a full-blooded model would be difficult to implement, a modest basic income grafted onto the existing system and still paid to all would be feasible, affordable and highly progressive. One paying weekly rates of £60 per adult (up to the age of 64) and £40 per child – amounting to a still significant, no questions asked, £10,400 a year for a family of four – would boost lower incomes, cut poverty sharply and narrow the income inequality gap.8 It would end sanctioning, provide a new income plimsoll line sitting under the existing social security system, while, for the first time, the unpaid and often unrecognised army of carers and volunteers, mostly women, would receive an income. This would correct one of the injustices of the present loaded politics of reciprocity. By providing all citizens with much more choice over work, education, training, leisure and caring, it would also lay the foundation for greater personal empowerment and freedom. Such a scheme offers a new vision for social protection in today's more turbulent world. An income floor is not a silver bullet. It would need to be buttressed by other policies to raise the share of the cake accruing to those at the bottom, a necessary condition for cutting mass impoverishment. But such a built-in floor would reinstate the principle of universalism and lower dependency on means-testing. Over time, the floor could be gradually raised by tapping into Britain's personal wealth mountain. Tweaking is not the answer to a deeply flawed system of social security. As Beveridge declared in his 1942 report, the time “is not for patching”.9 Stewart Lansley is the author of Basic Income for All: From desirability to feasibility (Compass, 2019) (with Howard Reed).

But because they lower the implicit marginal taxation rate of individuals entering the workforce, they have the effect of increasing economic inequality between those who opt out of the workforce and those who choose to participate. This article examines the effect that an increase in this income gap can be expected to have on the perceived adequacy of the UBI payment level as an alternative to paid employment. The first question involves the extent to which individuals living on UBI payments will assess the adequacy of their condition by comparing themselves to those who are adjacent to them in the income distribution. If this looms large in their assessment, then the UBI, by increasing inequality within this segment of the income distribution, will tend to increase the perception of its own inadequacy. The second question involves the importance of the consumption of positional goods in determining the adequacy of the UBI. If these are significant then again this will increase the perception of inadequacy, because those in paid employment will enjoy a great deal more than those who opt out.",https://doi.org/10.1111/japp.12569,Why a <scp>UBI</scp> Will Never Be High Enough,https://openalex.org/W4200177648

In this paper we want to explore the feasibility, the desirability and the features of a universal policy of minimum income in Italy. We use a microeconometric model and a social welfare methodology in order to evaluate various alternatives mechanisms. We simulate the effects and the social welfare performance of 30 reforms resulting from six versions of five basic types of income support mechanism: guaranteed minimum income (GMI), universal basic income (UBI), wage subsidy (WS) and two mixed systems: GMI+WS and UBI+WS. As welfare evaluation criteria we adopt the Gini Social Welfare function and the Poverty-Adjusted Gini Social Welfare function. All the reforms are calibrated so as to preserve fiscal neutrality. The simulation adopts a methodology that allows for market equilibrium and ensures a consistent comparative statics interpretation of the results. Universal and non mean-tested transfers (possibly complemented by wage subsidy) emerge as desirable and feasible features of the income support mechanism. In the most realistic scenarios, the social-welfare-optimal policies are a modest unconditional transfer amounting to 40% of the poverty line complemented by a 10% wage subsidy or – depending on the social welfare criterion – a more generous unconditional transfer (100% of the poverty line). The reforms can be financed by proportionally increasing the current marginal tax rates and widening the tax base to include all personal incomes.

Social security reform that fails to address the structural problem of low take‐up is unlikely to yield substantial social benefits. A universal basic income grant, provided as an entitlement and without a means test, will more readily reach the poorest population. By removing the stigma that labels the recipient as “poor”, the grant bolsters economic support without draining psychological resources. Its universal nature addresses the problem of low take‐up, and dispensing with the means test lowers the cost of accessing the grant to both government and beneficiaries. Providing the grant as a fundamental right reduces arbitrary discretion, minimising opportunities for corruption. The basic income grant enables the social security system to reduce the poverty gap by 74%. The basic income grant also supports economic growth through facilitating the accumulation of human and social capital, and job creation, and bolstering aggregate demand in the economy. A well‐managed basic income grant programme is affordable and consistent with fiscal responsibility.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02533950208458733,"The social, economic and fiscal impact of comprehensive social security reform for South Africa",https://openalex.org/W2085484606
-41.658985,15.794518,1,The article critically examines the assumption implicit in the research on social solidarity and popular attitudes that institutional solidarity equates with mutual care in society. Following a review of a selection of recent empirical research on social solidarity and popular attitudes to welfare it is concluded that the evidence points to general support for welfare based on self-interest and the principle of mutual insurance rather than social altruism . The analysis proceeds by arguing that social and economic changes which have resulted in social polarisation have weakened ‘functional democracy’ (the reciprocal dependency of one social group or class on another) leading to possible ‘decivilising tendencies’ and a decline in mutual empathy. The article argues that post-emotionalism may be the result of these processes: the breakdown in mutual knowledge across the class divide; the intellectualisation of feelings; interaction based on false ‘niceness’; the manipulation of emotions. The paper concludes by suggesting that post-emotional attitudes are the by-product of government social steering towards amoral familism in social policy through the provision of a ‘vocabulary of motives’ which are negative to state welfare.,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279403007050,"Social Solidarity, Welfare and Post-Emotionalism",https://openalex.org/W1986312131

This is not easily explained by standard political economy theory, which predicts a positive relationship between inequality and redistribution. One set of explanations for this puzzle focuses on whether and why redistributive preferences are muted in the presence of high inequality. While much recent research has focused on citizens’ preferences over government spending, we argue that preferences over taxation are a central piece of this puzzle. This article implements an experimental conjoint survey design to measure American income tax preferences across six income brackets. We find that policy opinions are generally progressive but that preferences do not vary substantially from current tax policies, and support for taxing the rich is highly inelastic.

-10.399742,-24.655308,0,"In a 2017 interview, Microsoft founder Bill Gates recommended taxing robots to slow the pace of automation. Funds raised could be used to retrain and financially support displaced workers. Up to 47 per cent of US jobs are at risk by advancements in artificial intelligence. Low-wage workers currently hold a majority of those at-risk jobs. Increased automation is likely to exacerbate income inequality. While employment changes due to automation are not new, advances in artificial intelligence threaten to eliminate many more jobs than were eliminated historically through automation. Accelerated automation presents two problems: a revenue problem and a human problem. The revenue problem exists because the tax system is designed to tax labour more heavily than capital, as labour is less likely to be able to avoid taxation. Capital investment, on the other hand, is taxed more lightly because capital is mobile and can escape taxation. When capital becomes labour, as in automation, the bottom falls out of the system. The human problem is first that most people need income from working to survive. Some scholars have advocated for a governmentally provided universal basic income (UBI). Taxing robots could in theory provide revenue for a UBI, although any source of revenue would work just as well. While a UBI would solve the survival problem, humans need more than basic survival. In his classic work, psychologist Abraham Maslow listed survival as the foundation of his hierarchy of needs. Work satisfies the higher order needs of social identity and self-esteem. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ), enacted in December 2017, significantly cut the US corporate tax rate, from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. In addition, TCJA increased tax benefits for purchasing equipment (which would include automation) by significantly enhancing bonus depreciation. The new tax legislation continued and deepened the existing tax bias towards automation. This article explores policy options for solving the revenue problem and the ""jobs"" problem, including a discussion and critique of UBI proposals and recommendations for other policy options, such as an enhanced earned income tax credit, incentives for employers, and reviving an idea from the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps.",https://doi.org/10.7202/1074155ar,I Robot: U Tax?

Marital instability increased even when an experimental plan was no more generous than AFDC for the splitting wife. The conclusion must be either that because of differences in information, stigma, or transaction costs, the experiments produced more powerful independence effects than an equivalent amount of AFDC, or that receiving NIT payments somehow reduced the attractiveness of the married state by calling into question the success of the husband as provider. These findings suggest that, if strengthening marriages is a public-policy objective, two-parent families would be better aided by wage subsidies that reduce the unemployment of family heads and raise the earnings of the family's working members.",https://doi.org/10.2307/145286,"Jobs, Cash Transfers and Marital Instability: A Review and Synthesis of the Evidence",https://openalex.org/W1535789494

The new means tested benefit integrated the former social assistance (a welfare benefit) and the former unemployment assistance for long-term unemployed persons whose entitlement to unemployment insurance payments had expired. Its paradigm is summarized in the slogan “support and challenge” (in German “fordern und fordern”). Support for integration into employment was extended to groups that had formerly been far detached from the labour market. On the other hand status protection regulations were disestablished and pressure on recipients to take up any reasonable employment was increased by the introduction of benefit sanctions and active labour market programmes designed to test work motivation.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12651-013-0149-7,Journal for labour market research: special issue PASS,https://openalex.org/W2060633006

This has occurred within the ruling African National Congress, even though sympathy for the poor remains constant outside of government. To do so, the paper starts in mid- and late-nineteenth-century England, where Victorian intellectuals and policy-makers grappled with the challenge of a growing urban proletariat and the emergence of what Disraeli described as 'two nations'—a recurrent theme of the ANC government under President Mbeki—and the two newly democratising countries grappled with the 'revolutionary threat and humanitarian disgrace' of poverty. The paper then analyses recent ANC discourse around the poor and anti-poverty interventions. The unresolved tensions within the ANC-led tripartite alliance, it is argued, are directly implicated in its failure adequately to conceptualise poverty, and 14 years into democracy, South Africa lacks an anti-poverty strategy, targets, or target groups. The paper ends by suggesting a method for identifying the 'ultra-poor', which is critical in place of the 'spray and pray' approach currently in use if poverty is substantially to be rolled back.

Yet in his major published studies, he has almost nothing to say about markets, nor about the economy more generally. I contend that this is a seriously problematic omission, insofar as markets represent a major problem for republican views of freedom. In short: if freedom requires the absence of the mere possibility of arbitrary interference (as Pettit maintains), then the widespread existence of markets indicates that on a republican view the vast majority of people in the world today exist in the dominated position of slaves. As a result, Pettit cannot adopt the “complacency” towards market transactions that he officially avows. But in turn, we ought to be highly skpetical that the republican account of freedom is a viable one.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0034670519000226,"Liberty, Nondomination, Markets",https://openalex.org/W2964047943

In some situations, this income is most effectively assured through social in surance programs where payments are conditioned on prior earnings and contributions. These programs maintain mini mum income by anticipating situations where interruption of earnings would cause need. In other situations, payments in the form of cash or subsidized food, housing or medical care are based on the prior existence of need. These programs help to define the labor market by setting conditions under which people are entitled to income on criteria other than work. A full employment policy should open new options to those individuals who prefer to work.

In this paper we want to explore the feasibility, the desirability and the features of a universal policy of minimum income in Italy. We use a microeconometric model and a social welfare methodology in order to evaluate various alternatives mechanisms. We simulate the effects and the social welfare performance of 30 reforms resulting from six versions of five basic types of income support mechanism: guaranteed minimum income (GMI), universal basic income (UBI), wage subsidy (WS) and two mixed systems: GMI+WS and UBI+WS. As welfare evaluation criteria we adopt the Gini Social Welfare function and the Poverty-Adjusted Gini Social Welfare function. All the reforms are calibrated so as to preserve fiscal neutrality. The simulation adopts a methodology that allows for market equilibrium and ensures a consistent comparative statics interpretation of the results. Universal and non mean-tested transfers (possibly complemented by wage subsidy) emerge as desirable and feasible features of the income support mechanism. In the most realistic scenarios, the social-welfare-optimal policies are a modest unconditional transfer amounting to 40% of the poverty line complemented by a 10% wage subsidy or – depending on the social welfare criterion – a more generous unconditional transfer (100% of the poverty line). The reforms can be financed by proportionally increasing the current marginal tax rates and widening the tax base to include all personal incomes. The set of universalistic policies that are preferable to the current system is very large and gives the opportunity of selecting a best reform according to many different criteria.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1955399,Five Issues in the Design of Income Support Mechanisms: The Case of Italy,https://openalex.org/W3124155479

Funds raised could be used to retrain and financially support displaced workers. Up to 47 percent of U.S.   are at risk by advancements in artificial intelligence. Low-wage workers currently hold a majority of those at-risk jobs. Increased automation is likely to exacerbate income inequality. 

While employment changes due to automation are not new, advances in artificial intelligence threaten many more   much more quickly than historic automation did. Accelerated automation presents two problems: a revenue problem and a human problem. The revenue problem exists because the tax system is designed to tax labor more heavily, as labor is less likely to be able to avoid taxation. Capital investment, on the other hand, is taxed more lightly because capital is mobile and can escape taxation. When capital becomes labor, as in automation, the bottom falls out of the system. The human problem is first that most people need income from working to survive. Some scholars have advocated for a governmentally provided universal basic income (UBI). Taxing robots could in theory provide revenue for a UBI, although any source of revenue would work just as well. While this would solve the survival problem, humans need more than basic survival. In his classic work, psychologist Abraham Maslow put survival at the bottom of his hierarchy of needs. Work satisfies the higher order needs of social identity and self-esteem. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), enacted in December 2017, significantly cut the U.S. corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent. In addition, TCJA increased tax benefits for purchasing equipment (which would include automation), significantly enhancing bonus depreciation. The new tax legislation continued and deepened the existing tax bias towards automation.

34.33831,-25.433176,3,"Should the EU be involved in the governance of minimum income protection, and if it should, in which role precisely? This question raises a complex policy conundrum. We focus on a proposal by the European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) for an EU Framework Directive on Minimum Income Protection, in order to examine three aspects of that policy conundrum: (1) the instrumental relevance of minimum income protection; (2) the unequal burden of the redistributive effort that would be required across the EU if the Union were to impose hic et nunc a minimum income guarantee of 60% or 40% of the median national income in all Member States; and (3) the impact on dependency traps, under the same hypothesis. We illustrate each of these observations empirically, using cross-nationally comparable data on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) and minimum income protection levels (CSB-MIPI). Since a harmonised minimum income scheme requires a significantly greater budgetary effort on behalf of some of the poorer Member States in Eastern and Southern Europe, it raises a complex question about the meaning of solidarity within the EU. Enhanced solidarity within Member States cannot be decoupled from enhanced solidarity among Member States - and vice versa. Simultaneously, the EU should put positive pressure on poorer and richer Member States to gradually improve the overall quality and efficiency of their welfare regimes. In this context, the prospect of gradually and flexibly introducing a more binding EU framework on minimum income protection may become realistic.",,The EU and minimum income protection: clarifying the policy conundrum,https://openalex.org/W3021492074

The redistribution economics, the relationship between capital and labour, the issues of the precariat, guaranteed minimum income for each citizen – both conditional and unconditional, which is a new idea for economy and the society – become more and more apparent in the aforementioned areas. The idea stems from the criticism of neoliberalism, and it interferes with the system of values shaped under capitalism, the role of the welfare state, the welfare system from the perspective of institutions and beneficiaries, who would replace their current privileges with inalienable rights.

However, research on the individual and institutional determinants of UBI support is scarce. The present study attempts to fills this gap by analysing workers’ attitudes towards UBI schemes in 21 European welfare states and focusing on the roles of precarious work (i.e. part-time work, temporary employment, low-skilled service employment, and solo self-employment) and unemployment benefit generosity (i.e. net replacement rate, payment duration, and qualifying period). We estimate fixed and random effects logistic models by merging country-level institutional data with the European Social Survey Round 8 data collected in 2016. The findings show that temporary employment is associated with positive attitudes towards UBI schemes, whereas other types of precarious work do not have significant influences.

This article claims that most of the arguments used to assert the superiority of SELR fail their objective, for the following reasons: first, SELR falls short in its reformulation of capitalism because neither SELR nor UBI alone can euthanize the rentier class. Second, most accounts are based on a flawed assumption that UBI leads to rampage inflation. Third, if macroeconomic considerations are not enough to justify implementing SELR over UBI, then insisting on the superiority of SELR can only stem from two types of moral reasons: on one hand from a perfectionist view of empowering the worst-off through labor and on the other from demands and obligations of reciprocity.

We employ a general equilibrium approach that allows us to assess not only the direct impact of alternative Roma integration policies but also to capture all induced feedback effects. Our simulation results suggest that although Roma integration policies would be costly for the public budget, in the medium‐to‐long run, economic, budgetary and fiscal benefits may significantly outweigh short‐ to medium‐run Roma integration costs. Depending on the integration policy scenario and the analysed country, the full repayment of the integration policy investment (positive net present value) may be achieved after 7 to 9 years.

Indeed, across the ideological political spectrum, work is often seen as a moral or civic duty and as a necessary basis for personal dignity. And this normative stance is now instantiated in federal and state law, from the tax scheme to public benefits. This Article reflects critically on this new regime of work. I ask whether the normative principles to which its advocates typically appeal actually justify the regime. I conclude that the case for a pro tanto moral or civic duty to work is not as strong as many believe and that there are reasonable responses to joblessness that do not involve instituting a work regime. However, even if we grant that there is a duty to work, I maintain that the ghetto poor would not be wronging their fellow citizens were they to choose not to work and to rely on public funds for material support. In fact, I argue that many among the black urban poor have good reasons to refuse to work.

These can be thought of as philosophical and microeconomic avenues of approach, respectively, and each is amply represented in this book.

Examples of this approach include Mitchell and Watts (2004), who compare the macroeconomic consequences of a BIG to those of a job guarantee program, and Moutos and Scarth (2003), who consider the operation of a BIG in both an open and a closed economy. This chapter argues that the macroeconomic perspective is critical, given the dramatic and broadly distributed changes in household income resulting from a BIG, as well as its highly predictable structure.

In December 2013, the Minister for Social Services, the Hon. Kevin Andrews MP, appointed an independent Reference Group to review Australia's welfare system. This is the Reference Group’s Interim Report. Mr Patrick McClure AO chairs the Reference Group. The other members are Mr Wesley Aird and Ms Sally Sinclair. The Reference Group was supported by a Taskforce in the Department of Social Services in preparing this report. Executive summary Government cash transfer payments to individuals and families represent the most significant component of Australia’s social support system in expenditure terms. The Department of Social Services has policy responsibility for income support payments and supplements worth around $100 billion in 2012–13. This is a significant investment with a wide reach across the community. Changes to Australia’s income support system over time have resulted in unintended complexities, inconsistencies and disincentives for some people to work. The system is also out of step with today’s labour market realities and community expectations. The income support system is in need of major reform to deliver better outcomes for all Australians now and into the future. Long-term reliance on income support increases the risks of poor health, low self-esteem and social isolation. It can also have intergenerational effects. Children who grow up in households with long periods on income support are more likely to have poor education, employment and social outcomes. In contrast, employment generates clear financial, health and social benefits for individuals, families and communities. To maximise employment and social outcomes, and to remain sustainable over the longer term, Australia’s income support system needs to have a stronger employment focus. It should provide adequate support while encouraging more people to work to their capacity. It should also be simpler and more coherent. While reforms in recent decades have increased participation expectations for income support recipients, a more fundamental reform of the architecture of the system is needed to better capture evolving labour market and social changes such as the growth in part-time work and the increased labour force participation of women. The broader social support system should work in tandem with the income support system to assist those most in need. This includes well-functioning employment services, housing assistance, child care, and early intervention and integrated services for people and families with complex needs, such as homelessness, mental health conditions and drug or alcohol addiction. Reform needs to take account of recent developments such as the system of lifelong care and support for people with disability being introduced through the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the expansion of paid parental leave and the opportunities offered by new technology. It should also take account of effective interventions to support people who are vulnerable in the labour market, such as people with mental health conditions and people with disability.

In a number of countries, such as Canada, Finland and the Netherlands, local experiments involving basic income have been taking place. This article addresses the main arguments for and against basic income. Some authors regard basic income as a populist and paternalist policy, which is an incorrect judgment, as its adequate implementation could lead to budgetary savings, reduce the size of government, and lower state interference in the lives of citizens. Another objection is that basic income would discourage labor and stimulate social dependency; however, local experiments in partial introduction of basic income and similar benefits have not confirmed this statement. The claim that basic income is too expensive of a measure does not consider that it is supposed to replace numerous other social benefits and would therefore most likely result in reduced administrative costs. Basic income is a social welfare measure most compatible with the nature of labor and the labor market under the technological revolution that has begun, where labor has been getting increasingly distributed and aimed at the workers’ self-realization rather than their survival. In practice, basic income is to be implemented gradually, only covering selected groups of individuals at first and expanding the range of recipients over time.

This paper addresses the question of whether income inequality is associated with the population prevalence of depression and, if so, the potential mechanisms and pathways which may explain this association. Our systematic review included 26 studies, mostly from high-income countries. Nearly two-thirds of all studies and five out of six longitudinal studies reported a statistically significant positive relationship between income inequality and risk of depression; only one study reported a statistically significant negative relationship. Twelve studies were included in a meta-analysis with dichotomized inequality groupings. The pooled risk ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07-1.31), demonstrating greater risk of depression in populations with higher income inequality relative to populations with lower inequality. Multiple studies reported subgroup effects, including greater impacts of income inequality among women and low-income populations. We propose an ecological framework, with mechanisms operating at the national level (the neo-material hypothesis), neighbourhood level (the social capital and the social comparison hypotheses) and individual level (psychological stress and social defeat hypotheses) to explain this association. We conclude that policy makers should actively promote actions to reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation policies and a basic universal income. Mental health professionals should champion such policies, as well as promote the delivery of interventions which target the pathways and proximal determinants, such as building life skills in adolescents and provision of psychological therapies and packages of care with demonstrated effectiveness for settings of poverty and high income inequality.",https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20492,Income inequality and depression: a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the association and a scoping review of mechanisms,https://openalex.org/W2787017245

The introduction of a UBI, funded by progressive consumption and wealth taxes, should be on the research agenda of economics, and on the policy agenda in representative democracies.

Recently, two alternatives to the growth paradigm have been put forward: namely, ""a-growth"" and ""degrowth."" The first proposes to ignore GDP information and focus instead on sound environmental, social, and economic policies independently of their effects on economic growth. The second recommends a downscaling of the economy so as to make it consistent with biophysical boundaries. We compare these approaches in the context of the growth paradigm and examine whether they have any merit.

There appears to be an indefensible asymmetry in the way political liberalism treats disagreements about justice and disagreements about the good life. This is the asymmetry objection to political liberalism. The principal aim of this article is to show that the asymmetry objection can be refuted. This is done by drawing a distinction between two different types of reasonable disagreement that can occur between citizens. The first type is foundational disagreement. Disagreements of this type are characterized by the fact that the participants do not share any premises which can serve as a mutually acceptable standard of justification. The second type of disagreement, justificatory disagreement, occurs when participants do share premises that serve as a mutually acceptable standard of justification, but they nevertheless disagree about certain substantive conclusions. Making this distinction allows me to show why political liberalism’s asymmetric treatment of justice and the good life is both defensible and desirable.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1470594x05056606,"Disagreement, asymmetry, and liberal legitimacy",https://openalex.org/W2162632589

These policies, unlike Basic Income, try to intensify the link between employment and the right to cash benefits. My thesis is that, in present socio-economic conditions, it is much more equitable and efficient to uncouple income support from employment.

Low unemployment and decent wages are supposed to guarantee people a labor market income or income maintenance, which in turn should provide a proper standard for everyone. However, a rapid increase in unemployment and economic problems have made the future of the Swedish welfare state more uncertain than ever. These circumstances have, among other things, led to the suggestion that Sweden should abandon the income maintenance policy and create a social policy system with the more limited ambition of guaranteeing everyone a minimum income. In that case, one central question must be answered: what constitutes a decent minimum income in today's Sweden? Where should we draw the poverty line under which people will not be forced to live? These questions are central in the current debate. The consensual poverty line method is used in this article to derive a poverty line relevant for today's Sweden. The results shows that more than every fifth household has an income below the consensual poverty line. That is, they have an income that most Swedes would argue is too low to make ends meet. The level of the consensual poverty line was compared with the National Board of Health and Welfare's guidelines for social assistance. The consensual poverty line was shown to be more generous to small households and the norm for social assistance was more generous to larger households. Finally, the expenditure for guaranteeing all Swedish household a minimum income equal to the consensual poverty line was estimated: more than SEK 25 billion per year. The results in the article casts serious doubt on the ability of the Swedish welfare state to secure a decent income to all citizens.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2397.1995.tb00097.x,Making ends meet: perceptions of poverty in Sweden,https://openalex.org/W1994401912

It shows that replacing the 2011 Public Distribution System (PDS) with a UBI results in losses for many low-income households, although much of this can be reduced by recycling the 'out-of-system' PDS losses and the fiscal savings from excluding the highest-income groups as higher UBI transfers. In contrast, replacing inefficient energy subsidies-raising energy prices to efficient levels to internalize the negative environmental externalities of energy consumption-could simultaneously deliver unambiguous distributional gains, help address fiscal pressures, and improve energy efficiency with associated environmental and health gains.

44.96633,-24.718576,3,"The subject of a Basic Income (BI) has become increasingly discussed in the political debate. A BI is a monthly stipend paid to every adult citizen, regardless of what they decide to do with it. Research suggests a BI could grant more financial freedom and increased health amongst people. However, it could also work counterproductive, as it takes away a strong motivator to work: money. A few trials have been run in the past, knowledge on the psychological effects or attitudes of those living with a Basic Income is lacking. One way to study potential effects of BI, is called futuring. With futuring, people imagine a possible future for themselves and then respond to questions or assignments as though they are actually living that future. By imagining the future, researchers may be able to find some attitudes towards and psychological effects of a future event, like the Basic Income. This study aimed to add to the discussion and research in this subject, by using focus group discussions to study people’s attitudes towards the BI and a questionnaire studying the Time Perspective. It will look at a relationship between a person’s Time Perspective and their attitudes towards the Basic Income. To measure an individual’s Time Perspective, Zimbardo and Boyd’s (1999) Time Perspective Index (ZTPI) was used. Making use of both focus group discussions and questionnaires, this study used 14 participants to study people’s general attitudes towards the BI. Two discussion groups consisting of seven participants each were held, during which the participants were asked to imagine a future in which they received a Basic Income, and then they were invited to elaborate on the BI. Afterwards, the ZTPI questionnaire was filled in. The ZTPI exists of 56 questions, that are divided among 5 sub-scales: (1) Past Negative (PN), (2) Past Positive (PP), (3) Present Fatalistic (PF), (4) Present Hedonistic (PH), and (5) Future (F). The focus group discussions were transcribed and coded with Atlas.ti, resulting in a code scheme of 6 codes. These codes were (1) Basic Income Positive, (2) Basic Income Negative, (3) Basic Income Conditional, (4) Future (F), (4.5) Freedom to do other things, and (5) Stress Relief. The results showed that most people were fairly positive about the BI. Some people were more sceptical and had more critical questions about the BI, such as those high in the Past and Present Positive orientation. However, everyone liked the idea of BI in some shape or form, in the end. Due to a small participant group, the results can be questioned.

We believe that most researchers would accept that additional income, or reduced conditions on receiving income would be likely to improve health, especially at lower income levels. However, there are genuine uncertainties about the impacts on other outcomes, and CBI as a mechanism of providing income. There is also less consensus amongst civil servants and politicians about the impacts on health, and substantial disagreement about whether these would outweigh other impacts. We believe that an RCT is ethical because of these uncertainties.

The growing wealth inequality, the precarization of work, as well as the threat of technological unemployment — all these issues have caused a new wave of interest in universal approaches to the development of social systems. This wave reached its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic, which required emergency measures to support the economy and employment. In a number of countries, the idea of a complete or partial transition from traditional social protection schemes to equal payments for all has gained wide public support and was included in the programs of influential political parties. Many new experiments have been planned or are already under way to assess the UBI’s potential positive and negative effects. The major stumbling block, however, is the problem of funding. Analyzing the proposals put forward in the academic, expert and political communities, the author of the article comes to the conclusion that the transition to a full-fledged UBI even in the most developed countries will be associated with an unacceptable increase in the budget deficit and government debt. A more realistic scenario is the gradual incorporation of certain elements of basic income into existing social systems.

This study examines the international evidence on universal basic incomes and identifies key issues for consideration in the design of any UBI pilot for Ireland. Despite the mainstream interest in UBI as a potential policy tool, relatively little is known about the associated consequences of such policies. Even the definition of a UBI appears to be poorly understood and is often misused in the public discourse. Several pilot studies have been recently implemented across different countries. However, some pilot studies depart from the accepted definition of UBI. For example, some are not universal, in that they only target a specific subgroup of the population and/or have eligibility restrictions based on earnings. Others provide a relatively low level of payment, which may fall short of what an individual could reasonably be expected to live on. There are a number of potentially positive impacts associated with a UBI. A universal, unconditional payment could eliminate the stigma associated with welfare receipt. If replacing existing welfare payments, a UBI would also involve lower transaction costs, both on the recipient (in terms of the application procedure) and on Government (in terms of administering the payment). Universal, unconditional payments would also avoid situations where people choose not to work in order to retain means-tested benefits. UBI could give individuals the freedom to turn down or leave insecure, exploitative or low-paid work in pursuit of better or improved work opportunities. In addition, it would mean that persons in informal and often unpaid work, such as childcare and eldercare, which is mostly done by women, receive some compensation for their labour. Empirical results from several pilot studies have found evidence of positive health impacts following the implementation of a UBI. In terms of potential disadvantages, a UBI, by definition, may not target those that are most in need, as a large percentage of recipients will be high-earning individuals. Furthermore, the cost of a UBI is likely to be very expensive, even if other existing benefits (such as unemployment benefits) are no longer required. The net impacts of a UBI on labour supply are unclear, with both positive and negative influences on labour market participation potentially arising as a consequence of a UBI. In this study, we undertake some basic calculations relating to four possible UBI approaches, all of which would involve an unconditional payment to every individual aged over 18 in Ireland.",https://doi.org/10.26504/rs146,A universal basic income for Ireland: Lessons from the international literature,https://openalex.org/W4315865395

Edward Ousselin Western Washington University Andrew Yang The War on Normal People: The Truth about America’s Disappearing Jobs and Why Universal Basic Income Is Our Future New York. Hachette. 2018. 284 pages. The case for universal basic income (UBI)—whereby the state makes regular, unconditional income payments to all its working-age citizens—is gaining increasing traction in the United States. Though the concept of UBI is nothing new to American politics, it has acquired renewed relevance in the face of a pressing modern issue: the automation of jobs. Andrew Yang makes one of the more noteworthy arguments in favor of UBI in his urgent new book, The War on Normal People. Yang is clearly a man of action. He is the founder of Venture for America and has recently filed for candidacy in the 2020 US presidential elections. With The War on Normal People, he not only draws attention to current socioeconomic issues but goes on to proposes concrete measures to face them. Yang uses the word “normal ” in the sense of “average” but reminds his readers that the “average” falls lower than they might think. As Yang points out, “the normal American did not graduate from college and doesn’t have an associate ’s degree. He or she perhaps attended college for one year or graduated high school [and] has a net worth of . . . about $6K excluding home and vehicle equity.” It is these “normal” Americans for whom the consequences of shifting from human to machine labor have been and will be most dire. Although “automation [has already] eliminated millions of manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2015,” Yang believes that the bulk of its impact is yet to come: “I love capitalism[, but] capitalism with the assistance of technology is about to turn on normal people.” However, to think that high-qualification white-collar jobs are immune to this change would be mistaken. The key criterion for the automation of a profession is the extent to which that profession is repetitive or routine, not the extent to which it is manual. Considering that the Federal Reserve classifies almost half of current US jobs as “routine,” Yang contends that the potential impact of continued automation is serious indeed. Yang sees as misguided in the current context the claim that technological revolutions always compensated loss of certain professions by the creation of new fields of employment. A number of specific manual professions becoming obsolete does not compare in quality or impact to any (including any new) routine work being lost to human employment. “History repeats itself until it doesn’t,” he cautions. As a solution to the socioeconomic vulnerability that would result from increasing automation, Yang proposes to pay a universal basic income, whereby each working-age adult is to receive a “Freedom Dividend” of $1,000 a month, which roughly hits the current national poverty line. To gauge the impact of his proposal, he lists a multitude of current and historical UBI experiments (from Alaska and Finland to UBI aid payments in Kenya), which seem to all offer similarly positive conclusions. For instance, in the Canadian town of Dauphin, thirteen thousand people received a four-year UBI, lifting everyone above the poverty line, with researchers finding “minimal effect on work.

This turn consists of the multiplication of measures aimed at bringing those who are unemployed closer to participation in the labour market. These measures often induce a strengthening of the conditions that must be met in order to receive social benefits. It is in this well known context that the authors gathered in this book decided to take a closer look at the relationship between activation policies for the unemployed and the right and the duty to work. If activation measures are likely to increase transitions towards the labour market, we can also make the assumption that they may, particularly when they are marked with the seal of coercion, hinder or dramatically reduce the right to freely chosen work. In such circumstances, the realisation of the «right to work», which is often stated to be the aim of those who promote activation, tends in practice to be reduced to an increasing pressure being exerted on the unemployed. In this case, isn’t it actually the duty to work that is particularly reinforced? After an historical and philosophical perspective on the issue, this assumption is confronted with the developments observed in the United States and in France, and then with the guidelines laid down in international human rights instruments.

From a Canadian city that once completely eradicated poverty, to Richard Nixon's near implementation of a basic income for millions of Americans, Bregman takes us on a journey through history, and beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he champions ideas whose time have come. Every progressive milestone of civilization -- from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy -- was once considered a utopian fantasy. Bregman's book, both challenging and bracing, demonstrates that new utopian ideas, like the elimination of poverty and the creation of the fifteen-hour workweek, can become a reality in our lifetime. Being unrealistic and unreasonable can in fact make the impossible inevitable, and it is the only way to build the ideal world.",,Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World,https://openalex.org/W3133533814

An experiment might be justified either because it gathers positive empirical evidence supporting rolling out a basic income, or because it justifies the moral desirability of such a measure. This paper critically explores both responses, the “empirical” and “ethical claim” in light of the Barcelona B-MINCOME pilot, alongside other similar experiments. We sustained that although the empirical claim is necessary, there seems to be sufficient data to easily predict that all future experiments are to gather positive results too. Consequently, we argue that experiments are particularly well-equipped to foster debates on the work ethics and on the ethical dimension of social policies and welfare regimes in general.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2021-0018,Why Do We Run Basic Income Experiments?

However, since the mid-1990s conditions have escalated considerably, with a raft of new administrative and activity conditions attached to the receipt of payments and tough financial sanctions imposed for non-compliance. Social security appeal rights have also been weakened and - with the introduction of income management policies - some benefit recipients have had conditions placed on where, and on what, their payments can be spent. Against this backdrop, some reformers argue for the eradication of punitive conditionalities and an increase in certain categories of payments; others, however, propose a more radical break with the past through the introduction of an unconditional and universal basic income that is paid to all permanent residents.

In these situations, the first pillar schemes have been developed (International Labour Organization, ILO). In 2005, the World Bank proposed to design an assignment for every citizen, paid annually according to their own situation, taking into account also both demographic and economic situation of the country. This economic assignment is according to the concept of basic social assistance benefits understood as an initial and basic social protection system to guarantee vital expenses of all citizens. This paper analyses the factors that determine the amount of expenses in essential needs of individuals. Thus, we have used the Spanish Household Budget Survey (2010) and analysed the factors (number of family members, number of dependents, region of residence, household head features, etc.) that determine essential needs applying a quantile regression. The regression result is then used to provide a basic income (BI) proposal for each household type. The aim of this study is to determine the amount of basic social assistance benefits which could protect citizens from social risks and resulting insecurities covering essential needs using those factors. Therefore, a social security benefit as basic social assistance one would be a powerful tool against poverty and inequality. As its main purpose is to meet the essential needs of individuals, then it could be used as a measure to guarantee a basic level of social and economic security for all members of society of the current minimum income grants and other benefits.",https://doi.org/10.18848/2324-7576/cgp/v09i01/53502,Level of Basic Income Provision Determined Through a Household Budget Survey,https://openalex.org/W2485028765

-25.688503,31.22882,5,"Recent debates about inequality have focused almost exclusively on the distribution of wealth and disparities in income, but little notice has been paid to the distribution of free time. Free time is commonly assumed to be a matter of personal preference, a good that one chooses to have more or less of. Even if there is unequal access to free time, the cause and solution are presumed to lie with the resources of income and wealth. This book argues that these views are fundamentally mistaken. First, it contends that free time is a resource, like money, that one needs in order to pursue chosen ends. Further, realizing a just distribution of income and wealth is not sufficient to ensure a fair distribution of free time. Because of this, anyone concerned with distributive justice must attend to the distribution of free time. On the basis of widely held liberal principles, the book explains why citizens are entitled to free time—time not committed to meeting life's necessities and instead available for chosen pursuits. The novel argument that the just society must guarantee all citizens their fair share of free time provides principled grounds to address critical policy choices, including work hours regulations, Sunday closing laws, public support for caregiving, and the pursuit of economic growth. The book demonstrates why all citizens have, in the words of early labor reformers, a right to “hours for what we will.”",https://doi.org/10.23943/princeton/9780691163451.001.0001,Free Time,https://openalex.org/W4249041682

These services, of which the social security benefits are only one portion, are held to be necessary for the survival, progress, and moral health of the nation.

Pilot studies of a UBI are underway or in the works on three continents. And prominent voices from across the ideological spectrum have expressed support for a UBI or one of its variants, including libertarian Charles Murray, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, labor leader Andy Stern, and — most recently — former President Barack Obama. Although even the most optimistic advocates for a UBI will acknowledge that nationwide implementation lies years away, the design of a basic income will require sustained scholarly attention. This article seeks to advance the conversation among academics and policymakers about UBI implementation. 

Our prior work has focused on the philosophical foundations of a basic income; here, we build up from those foundations to identify the practical building blocks of a large-scale cash transfer program. After canvassing the considerations relevant to the design of a UBI, we arrive at a set of specific recommendations for policymakers. We propose a UBI of $6000 per person per year, paid to all citizens and lawful permanent residents via direct deposit in biweekly installments. We argue — contrary to other UBI proponents — that children and seniors should be included, that adjustments for household size and cost of living should be rejected, that recipients should have a limited ability to use future payments as collateral for short- and medium-term loans, and that the Social Security Administration should carry out the program. We also explain how a UBI could be financed through the consolidation of existing cash and near-cash transfer programs as well as the imposition of a relatively modest surtax on all earners.

Importantly, the building blocks of a UBI do not necessarily determine its outward face. By this, we mean that economically identical programs can be described in very different ways — e.g., as a UBI with no phaseout, a UBI that phases out with income, and a “negative income tax” — without altering any of the essential features. To be sure, packaging matters to the public perception of a UBI, and we consider reasons why some characterizations of the program may prove more popular than others. Our article seeks to sort the building blocks of a UBI out from the cosmetic components, thereby clarifying which elements of a UBI shape implementation and which ones affect only the outward appearance.",,The Architecture of a Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2920675306

The article describes these legislative changes and analyses the practical implications for migration as well as whether the changes have had a deeper impact on values in Swedish social security. The analysis shows that the Swedish legislator and courts are struggling to strike a balance between residence-based social security and free movement of persons. An early – and also a major – change was to turn the guarantee-level pension into a pro-rata scheme. To follow up the consequences of this, a special non-contributory benefit had to be introduced to prevent an inflow of applicants into social assistance. However, this benefit has proved to be vulnerable to mobility. The implementation of Directive 2004/38 was made without any real changes of social security legislation. At a later stage this led to difficulties in the application of the various residence-concepts in Swedish law.

Because birth weight predicts a range of outcomes across the life course, lower birth weights that result from poverty may have lasting consequences for children’s life chances. Second, how have recent expansions of a work-based welfare program (i.e., the EITC) affected maternal and infant health? In recent decades, U.S. poverty relief has become increasingly tied to earnings and labor markets, but the consequences for children’s wellbeing remain controversial.

This complex issue is most often discussed around the role of robots in manufacturing where both repetitive and dangerous tasks performed by humans are being replaced by robotic counterparts that in many cases, can also perform these tasks more accurately. Similarly, the idea of automation through artificial intelligence poses a risk to workers far beyond physical labor, a topic highly discussed for the past few years. From this concern, theories on bringing your own robot to work, analogous to the bring your own device to work movement, have been brought up as a way into the future. Separately, in order to offset the economic downsides of the changing human labor force, and among other reasons, recent political discussions have been actively pursuing the idea of a universal basic income. This paper poses an alternative idea, one in which the advantages of robotics continues to benefit the laborers in which it replaces, and takes the bring your own robot to work to a macro scale: a universal basic robot. These two past proposals, one in which people bring their own robot to work, and one in which a universal basic income is given, have large differences in the way society itself will transform.

We analyse the employment and benefit trajectories of individuals who became recipients for the first time between 2007 and 2009 by methods of sequence and cluster analysis based on representative administrative individual data. We find a significant polarisation between long-term recipients and those with an early exit from benefit receipt via full-time employment. One in three new recipients remains in benefit receipt for the next years and shows almost no employment activities. Approximately 23 percent leave benefit receipt quickly and work in full-time employment. Several other different paths exist between these two poles.

However, the European social policy landscape today looks as varied as it did at any time during the 20th century. ‘New institutionalism’ seems particularly helpful to account for the divergent outcomes observed, and it explains the resistance of different structures to change through past commitments, the political weight of welfare constituencies and the inertia of institutional arrangements – in short, through ‘path dependency’. Welfare state institutions play a special role in framing the politics of social reform and can explain trajectories and forms of policy change. The institutional shape of the existing social policy landscape poses a significant constraint on the degree and the direction of change. This approach is applied to welfare state developments in the UK and France, comparing reforms of unemployment compensation, old-age pensions and health care. Both countries have developed welfare states, although with extremely different institutional features. Two institutional effects in particular emerge: schemes that mainly redistribute horizontally and protect the middle classes well are likely to be more resistant against cuts. Their support base is larger and more influential compared with schemes that are targeted on the poor or are so parsimonious as to be insignificant for most of the electorate. The contrast between the overall resistance of French social insurance against cuts and the withering away of its British counterpart is telling.

The first lesson Rawls took from Knight was that inheritance of talent and wealth are on a moral par. Knight highlighted the inconsistency of objecting to the inheritance of wealth while taking for granted the legitimacy of unequal reward based on differential productive capacity. Rawls agreed that there was an inconsistency, but claimed that it should be resolved by rejecting both kinds of inequality, except to the extent they benefitted the worst off. The second lesson Rawls learned from Knight was that the size of one’s marginal product depends on supply and demand, which depend on institutional decisions that cannot themselves be made on the basis of the principle of rewarding marginal productivity. The article claims that this argument about background justice overstates its conclusion, because the dependence of contribution on institutional setup is not total. Proposals for an unconditional basic income may therefore have a strike against them, as far as a reciprocity-based conception of desert is concerned.

The review and development of policy options was scheduled to be completed by 1975 with the implementation of chosen options to take a further two or three years. A prominent and much debated policy option with respect to income security was a guaranteed annual income. In 1974 the Government of Canada and the Province of Manitoba agreed jointly to undertake a guaranteed annual income experiment called the Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment. The primary research purpose of the experiment was to provide information respecting the labour supply response of the recipients of a system of guaranteed annual income payments. The experiment officially ended in March, 1979, but did not report on the labour supply response. This study examines the history and fate of the Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment. Two major conclusions are drawn. The first conclusion is that the Government of Canada had decided shortly after the experiment had begun that it would not support a one-tiered guaranteed annual income program such as was being tested by the experiment. The second conclusion is that social policy research that requires the use of rigorous and complex social science methodology should be considered an important part of the normal policy-making process, but should be conducted by a research body that is independent of the initiating government(s).",,Social experiments and social policy formulation: A study of the Manitoba basic annual income experiment.,https://openalex.org/W1797061553

These determinants refer to the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, including income, housing and education, among others.

We run regression analyses to estimate the effects on these evaluations and test for socio-economic, knowledge-based and value-based factors. Results show that (1) in Sweden a working time reduction is the most supported eco-social policy; (2) political left orientation increases support for all five eco-social policies; (3) socio-economic factors have effects on wealth tax, maximum income and working time reduction; and (4) knowledge-based factors are more associated with the meat tax.

This article explores the strengths and weaknesses of an ‘egalitarian earnings subsidy scheme’ (ESS) in which individuals receive (or pay) a subsidy (or tax) for each pound earned based on the difference between their earnings potential and their society’s average earnings potential. ESS corrects for brute luck inequality in earnings potentials in a well-targeted fashion; implements an attractive conception of reciprocity; and, in contrast to an alternative lump-sum tax proposal, does not entail the ‘slavery of the talented’. However, any practicable version of ESS may undermine at least one other egalitarian objective – that of maintaining equality of status amongst unequally talented citizens. As a status-friendly alternative, we might try to approximate ESS through a more conventional redistribution scheme using taxes and subsidies that implicitly ‘tag’ low- and high-ability individuals. While it is difficult to draw any firm policy conclusions, it seems clear that the idea of talent-based taxes and subsidies on the model of ESS should occupy a more prominent place in our thinking about tax–benefits policy to tackle earnings inequality.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123499000290,The Egalitarian Earnings Subsidy Scheme,https://openalex.org/W2007434483

It is a type of minimum income guarantee that differs from those that now exist in various European countries. Considered in its pure form, a basic in-come is paid (1) to individuals rather than households; (2) irrespective of wealth or any in-come from other sources; and (3) without requiring the performance of any work or the will-ingness to accept a job if offered. Its relevance to the problems of contemporary welfare states has long been recognized. From the 1970s onwards, forms of basic income have been regu-larly proposed for adapting the post-war institutions of social transfer to the conditions of a modern economy, in which lifetime security through earned income is no longer the norm. The guiding claim was that an unconditional floor of guaranteed income is justified as the fairest and the most efficient way of reconstructing basic security in the welfare state. Inevita-bly, the fairness part of this claim led to a principled debate concerning the unconditional features of basic income, in particular the absence of the requirement of willingness to work. The reason for this is obvious, for any moral justification of unconditional basic income has to deal with the objection that it is unfair to hand out transfers to able-bodied persons who are merely unwilling to earn a living. This theme has been explored in depth in Arguing for Basic Income (1992). This book is divided in two distinct but interrelated parts, both of which reflect the main topics of the 1998 Congress of the Basic Income European Network.

Overall, the introduction of the MIS has had a positive effect on the subjective well-being of its recipients over the program duration. We also find that the profound and lasting effect of material and food deprivation, and the continuous stress these entail, explain changes in subjective well-being better than the actual income level.

The assault is traced back to the emergence of the Centre for Social Justice think tank, founded in 2004 by the current Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan‐Smith. I argue that a familiar litany of social pathologies (family breakdown, worklessness, antisocial behaviour, personal responsibility, out‐of‐wedlock childbirth, dependency) is repeatedly invoked by the architects of welfare reform to manufacture ignorance of alternative ways of addressing poverty and social injustice. Structural causes of poverty have been strategically ignored in favour of a single behavioural explanation—“Broken Britain”—where “family breakdown” has become the central problem to be tackled by the philanthropic fantasy of a “Big Society”.

Some of the problems with the US negative income tax (NIT) experiments of the 1970s stemmed from a focus on the wrong question – focusing on the side effects rather the effects of the policy in question. A European BI experiment should focus on the question of policy effectiveness. The question of policy effectiveness should be formulated as follows: what policy (BI, the current system, or any other alternatives to be tested) produces the greatest increase in welfare for the poor (or the greatest decrease in poverty) per Euro of cost (both in terms of tax cost and efficiency loss)? Effectiveness is not the only important concern in assessing policy alternatives, but it is a critically important concern that anyone who is interested in the issue should consider. BI supporters argue – from theory – that BI is the most efficient and effective way to improve the welfare of the poor. A BI experiment can shed light on whether that theory is correct, and supporters and opponents alike agree that policy effectiveness is an important factor in determining the relative merits of policy alternatives.

Two versions of the fairness‐based case are considered. The first defends workfare on the grounds that it would form part of an unemployment insurance scheme that individuals would endorse under certain hypothetical conditions that are salient for the purposes of determining just public policy. The second appeals to the notion of reciprocity in order to justify the requirement that people work for their benefits. We cast doubt on both of these arguments for workfare.

Income is a key health determinant, and a basic income could affect health through its effect on other determinants, such as employment. However, there is little evidence of its potential effects on public health, because no studies of interventions which meet the definition of basic income have been done. However, there is evidence from studies of interventions with similarities to basic income. Therefore, we aimed to identify these studies and to consider what can be learned from them about the potential effects of such interventions on health and socioeconomic outcomes. We did a systematic scoping review of basic income-like interventions, searching eight bibliographic and eight specialist databases from inception to July, 2019, with extensive hand searching. We included publications in English of quantitative and qualitative studies done in upper-middle-income or high-income countries, of universal, permanent, or subsistence-level interventions providing unconditional payments to individuals or families. We sought to identify the range of outcomes reported by relevant studies, and report health, education, employment, and social outcomes. We extracted and tabulated relevant data and narratively reported effects by intervention and outcome. We identified 27 studies of nine heterogeneous interventions, some universal and permanent, and many evaluated using randomised controlled trials or robust quasi-experimental methods. Evidence on health effects was mixed, with strong positive effects on some outcomes, such as birthweight and mental health, but no effect on others. Employment effects were inconsistent, although mostly small for men and larger for women with young children. There was evidence of spill-over effects in studies measuring effects on large populations.

It is a process of practically realisable transformative steps which together with their combined and mutually reinforcing effects enable more radical social changes beyond a mere reform. The author argues that these transformative steps have to address two conditions embedded in the institutionalised structures of late modern capitalist society: the limited understanding of meaningful work as paid employment; and the liberal ideal of the independent and autonomous individual. Whereas a UBI can challenge the first condition, a public model of care questions the second condition by shifting the primary responsibility of care from the family towards a social solidarity.

The author believes that this topic can become one of the most relevant for social-philosophical research. The author notes that although the problem has been of concern to philosophers and scientists for a long time, it has become especially relevant only recently – over the past ten years. The following reasons are given as an explanation: (a) recent experiments on the introduction of a universal basic income in Western countries, (b) the trend toward automation and technologization, (c) the transformation of the economy, which is becoming more and more precarious. The author notes that the topic of universal basic income has become relevant even in Russian science, however, not in social philosophy, as in the West, but mainly in economics. The author argues that, since the discussion about basic income in the economic dimension has already taken place, it should be expanded to the field of social philosophy. To do this, the author raises a number of questions that will shed light on the social-philosophical nature of the problem of universal basic income – freedom, justice, welfare state, etc. Special attention is paid to the curious ideological transformations that became possible by the emergence of topic of basic income. First of all, basic income contributes to the formation of new ideologies, such as post-capitalism. Secondly, basic income itself can be considered as a new ideology, which is a synthesis of other ideological trends – libertarianism, feminism, Marxism, etc. Thirdly, post-capitalism, which emphasizes basic income, opens up much more significant problems than replacing labor and turning all people into a precariat.

The model shows that individuals with lower levels of political mistrust are more likely to endorse UBI, reflecting their trust in the government's ability to manage public resources and avoid wasteful retrenchment of other public services. The model also shows that generalised mistrust – characterised by agents' expectations of their fellow citizens' misbehaviour that can reduce the government's fiscal capacity – does not significantly influence preferences for UBI when it involves a partial retrenchment of other public services. This result is driven by the agents' perception that their fellow citizens' misbehaviour would occur irrespective of the UBI implementation.

Discussion: Despite the increasing implementation of such programs throughout the United States and their associated high cost, evidence is lacking based on their long-term impact and effectiveness. Further study is recommended including stronger evaluations of current and future programs.",https://doi.org/10.1177/10497315231202781,Are Universal and Guaranteed Basic Income Programs Effective in the United States?

Up to now, microsimulation research about UBI does not consider the behavioural responses due to a tax-benefit reform. We adopt a universal basic income reform, use two realistic extreme scenarios for household composition, and determine the performance in terms of inequality and poverty. Comparing this to the original tax-benefit system, we show that the poverty measure of universal basic income reacts more severe than in the original system. Therefore, we conclude that the inclusion of household composition should become standard practice in microsimulation research.",,Universal Basic Income Reforms and Household Composition : A Behavioural Microsimulation Analysis,https://openalex.org/W2910190818

-8.69353,46.759407,5,"Hannah Arendt’s support for the “right to have rights” arises as a critical response to the modern biopolitical human condition. While Arendt’s reflections on human rights have received broad recognition, the question concerning the economic preconditions of citizenship in her work remains an unduly neglected subject. This article takes up this issue and argues that, for Arendt, the fulfillment of basic social rights is the sine qua non without which the fulfillment of political rights is impossible. Thinking with and against Arendt, I show that her famous distinction between the private, the social, and the political can be fruitfully reinterpreted as an argument for basic income. When Arendt’s reflections on human rights are read in the light of her ideas concerning technology and automation, she no longer appears as a theorist who ignores social justice, but as a thinker who seeks to counter the modern biopolitical human condition and open up new realms for democratic political action. Instead of ignoring social questions, Arendt argues that with the help of technology, we can strive to politicize fundamental social questions in a way that they would achieve a self-evident stature as human rights, and as fundamental human rights, rise above political debate, even though we would remain conscious of their political origins. Arendt does not simply exclude “the social questions” from politics but argues that this is what all technologically developed societies can strive to do. In Arendt’s futuristic vision, the private life of citizens will be politicized through technological intervention: ancient slaves will be replaced by machines. By comparing Arendt with Foucault and Agamben, I maintain that a critical reading of her work can provide us with a pathway toward understanding the right to life’s basic necessities, to zoe, as a future human right.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0304375418789722,Resisting Biopolitics,https://openalex.org/W2884908882

The relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with conditional cash transfers (CCTs; provided so long as the recipient engages in prescribed behaviours such as using a health service or attending school) is unknown.To assess the effects of UCTs for improving health services use and health outcomes in vulnerable children and adults in LMICs. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of UCTs on social determinants of health and healthcare expenditure and to compare to effects of UCTs versus CCTs.We searched 17 electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE and Embase, in May 2017. We also searched six electronic grey literature databases and websites of key organisations, handsearched key journals and included records, and sought expert advice.We included both parallel group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort and controlled before-and-after (CBAs) studies, and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT or a smaller UCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome.Two reviewers independently screened potentially relevant records for inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We tried to obtain missing data from study authors if feasible. For cluster-RCTs, we generally calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes from crude frequency measures in approximately correct analyses. Meta-analyses applied the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method with random effects. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.We included 21 studies (16 cluster-RCTs, 4 CBAs and 1 cohort study) involving 1,092,877 participants (36,068 children and 1,056,809 adults) and 31,865 households in Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia in our meta-analyses and narrative synthesis. The 17 types of UCTs we identified, including one basic universal income intervention, were pilot or established government programmes or research experiments. The cash value was equivalent to 1.3% to 53.9% of the annualised gross domestic product per capita. All studies compared a UCT with no UCT, and three studies also compared a UCT with a CCT. Most studies carried an overall high risk of bias (i.e. often selection and/or performance bias). Most studies were funded by national governments and/or international organisations.Throughout the review, we use the words 'probably' to indicate moderate-quality evidence, 'may/maybe' for low-quality evidence, and 'uncertain' for very low-quality evidence. UCTs may not have impacted the likelihood of having used any health service in the previous 1 to 12 months, when participants were followed up between 12 and 24 months into the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09, P = 0.07, 5 cluster-RCTs, N = 4972, I² = 2%, low-quality evidence). At one to two years, UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, very large reduction in the likelihood of having had any illness in the previous two weeks to three months (odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93, 5 cluster-RCTs, N = 8446, I² = 57%, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence from five cluster-RCTs on food security was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that at 13 to 24 months' follow-up, UCTs could increase the likelihood of having been food secure over the previous month (low-quality evidence). UCTs may have increased participants' level of dietary diversity over the previous week, when assessed with the Household Dietary Diversity Score and followed up 24 months into the intervention (mean difference (MD) 0.59 food categories, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.01, 4 cluster-RCTs, N = 9347, I² = 79%, low-quality evidence). Despite several studies providing relevant evidence, the effects of UCTs on the likelihood of being moderately stunted and on the level of depression remain uncertain. No evidence was available on the effect of a UCT on the likelihood of having died. UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, moderate increase in the likelihood of currently attending school, when assessed at 12 to 24 months into the intervention (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09, 6 cluster-RCTs, N = 4800, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). The evidence was uncertain for whether UCTs impacted livestock ownership, extreme poverty, participation in child labour, adult employment or parenting quality. Evidence from six cluster-RCTs on healthcare expenditure was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that UCTs may have increased the amount of money spent on health care at 7 to 24 months into the intervention (low-quality evidence). The effects of UCTs on health equity (or unfair and remedial health inequalities) were very uncertain. We did not identify any harms from UCTs. Three cluster-RCTs compared UCTs versus CCTs with regard to the likelihood of having used any health services, the likelihood of having had any illness or the level of dietary diversity, but evidence was limited to one study per outcome and was very uncertain for all three.This body of evidence suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may not impact a summary measure of health service use in children and adults in LMICs. However, UCTs probably or may improve some health outcomes (i.e. the likelihood of having had any illness, the likelihood of having been food secure, and the level of dietary diversity), one social determinant of health (i.e. the likelihood of attending school), and healthcare expenditure.

The capability approach significantly contributed to legitimize these developments. The aim of this paper is to criticize this dominant interpretation of the capability approach in social policy, which reduces people’s capability to their capacity to participate in the economy. An alternative conceptualization of capability-enhancing social policy is then proposed. At the individual level, social policy should increase the number and variety of valuable options open to individuals. On the one hand, this means supporting—alongside employment—also care work and political participation. On the other hand, since the benefits of employment cannot be taken for granted, this requires also reforming the workplace in order to expand citizens’ agency and wellbeing. At the collective level, social policy should establish the social preconditions for an effective and substantive democracy, providing the social bases of political equality through a focus on redistribution and equal respect. This alternative conceptualization has also implications for education policy: rather than people’s human capital, education should enhance individual and collective autonomy.",https://doi.org/10.1080/19452829.2019.1661983,"What is a Capability-enhancing Social Policy?

But the idea of providing an unconditional basic income to every individual, rich or poor, active or inactive, has been advocated by such major thinkers as Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill, and John Kenneth Galbraith. For a long time, it was hardly noticed and never taken seriously. Today, with the traditional welfare state creaking under pressure, it has become one of the most widely debated social policy proposals in the world. Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght present the most comprehensive defense of this radical idea so far, advocating it as our most realistic hope for addressing economic insecurity and social exclusion in the twenty-first century. The authors seamlessly combine philosophy, politics, and economics as they compare the idea of a basic income with rival ideas past and present for guarding against poverty and unemployment. They trace its history, tackle the economic and ethical objections against an unconditional income--including its alleged tendency to sap incentives and foster free riding--and lay out how such an apparently implausible idea might be viable financially and achievable politically. Finally, they consider the relevance of the proposal in an increasingly globalized economy.

Consequently, UBI implementation would arguably facilitate the decision to become an entrepreneur. The contribution of the paper is threefold.

Those arguments emphasize the existence of higher involuntary underemployment among the poor and the fact that the type of work provided by these schemes gives disutility, deterring non-poor households from participating. To include these features, the consumption-based welfare metric used in past assessments of workfare schemes in underemployed developing countries is generalized to incorporate a welfare loss from casual manual work, while allowing the government to independently value the work done for other reasons. Using data for India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), the paper shows that the policy ranking switches in favor of a basic-income guarantee (BIG) over workfare. Allowing for a welfare loss from casual manual labor implies a more “poor-poor” targeting performance, but this is not sufficient to compensate for the direct welfare loss from the work requirement for plausible parameter values.

In this article, we provide a structured overview of the state of the art in the policy diffusion and transfer literature that deals specifically with social policy. We present and critically evaluate existing theoretical concepts and quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches that enable the analysis of interdependencies between countries. Moreover, we summarize the empirical findings of quantitative and qualitative studies on the diffusion and transfer of social policy, from some pioneering studies to the latest findings. Against this background we point out what we believe to be promising avenues for future research.

On the other hand, it aims to defend (justify) the same capitalism against its critics. Due to this theoretical double-bind, the book is forced to both prettify capitalism and to cover up the potential costs an unconditional basic income would have.

Some years prior to the publication in 1989, similar proposals had been widely discussed in Great-Britain and Continental Europe under the name of ‘basic income’. Yet, in Meade’s writings the idea of a social dividend was not new. In fact, throughout his life, it regularly resurfaces in many books and articles at least since 1935. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it documents the appearance of ‘social dividend’ in the early writings of James Meade. It also discusses different discursive communities Meade was involved in and which might have been possible origins for the term as well as for the idea of an unconditional equal payment to all. Secondly, it shows that in Meade’s writings a ‘social dividend’ plays different roles, prefiguring in a sense different approaches to ‘basic income’ in the present-day literature.

Many of the sweeping reforms carried out under the banner of the “Common Sense Revolution” received widespread coverage: for example, reductions in welfare rates, the introduction of the Ontario Works programme, the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy for so-called welfare fraud, and changes to the rules relating to common-law spousal relationships. However, much less attention has focused upon significant changes to the ways welfare is delivered. This paper critically interrogates a number of key changes to the Service Delivery Model in Ontario. After the passage of federal legislation in 1995, national entitlements to welfare have been terminated, replaced with local responsibility; this decentralization is changing not only the hierarchy of the regulation of poor people, but also the form and function of provision. In particular, there is evidence of the reinvention of administration towards the micro-regulation of job search and personal behaviour and the deterrence of welfare receipt as applicants and recipients are bureaucratically disentitled. Although administrative practices have historically acted as a secondary barrier to welfare receipt, the paper suggests that the current incarnation of work-enforcing reforms could be especially significant as the worlds of welfare and work continue to change.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9515.2005.00425.x,Rituals of Degradation: Administration as Policy in the Ontario Works Programme,https://openalex.org/W2056164465

Contemporary classifications and means testing for social grants are problematized as inefficient and discriminative. The BIG is regarded as right in the context of the big inequalities in Namibia.

Instead, we found evidence that labour supply increases globally among adults, men and women, young and old, and the existence of some insignificant and functional reductions to the system such as a decrease in workers from the following categories: Children, the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying.

The second option highlights the ownership of robots so that taking part in the new source of wealth is possible. The third focuses on strengthening the comparative advantages, the creativity, and the social intelligence of humans that robots will never be able to match.

This paper offers a comprehensive overview of these questions. Furthermore, in a broader sense these policy options—redistributing the benefits of technological changes, increasing accesses to the benefits and utilisation of changes, and supporting the individual and institutional adjustment to changes—are relevant to every technological transformation. Hence, the lessons that are drawn from the current discussion of policy options driven by specific technologies, robotization, and automation might serve as a precursor to potential policy responses triggered by other technologies.",,What are the policy options?

To this purpose, we compare two policy mixes and assess the synergies between working time reduction and two universal income schemes: a basic income and care income programme. While the former provides every individual with an equal monetary benefit, the latter ties monetary benefits to the amount of unpaid and care work performed by individuals. We assess the impact of these policy mixes by applying Eurogreen, a macrosimulation model tailored to Italy. Results suggest that while working time reduction directly drives a reduction of the aggregate amount of time spent by women in unpaid work, this does not imply a reduction in time poverty.

Decentralized implementation of the right-to-work poses serious challenges in poor places. Evidence on India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Act does not suggest that the potential for either providing work when needed or reducing current poverty is realized, despite pro-poor targeting. Instead, work is often rationed by local leaders, and the poverty impact is small when all the costs are considered. The option of income support using cash transfers also has both pros and cons. Widely-used methods for finely targeting cash transfers tend to miss many poor people, and can discourage those reached from earning extra income. Yet it cannot be presumed that switching to a universal basic income will reduce poverty more than workfare or finely-targeted transfers. That is an empirical question and the answer will undoubtedly vary across settings, belying the generalizations often heard from advocates.

Effective redistribution, they argued, resulted less from a Robin Hood logic – taking from the rich to give to the poor – than from a broad and egalitarian provision of services and transfers. Hence, the paradox: a country obtained more redistribution when it took from all to give to all than when it sought to take from the rich to help the poor. Recent studies, however, failed to confirm the existence of this paradox. This article suggests that the original argument was theoretically sound but inadequately operationalized. Korpi and Palme measured universalism indirectly, not by the design or character of social programmes, but rather by their outcomes, namely, by their income effects. These outcomes, however, are influenced by exogenous factors. We use two new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicators to capture universalism directly, through the institutional design of social programmes: (1) the percentage of social benefits that are means or income tested and (2) the proportion of private spending in total social expenditures. These two indicators are combined into a universalism index and tested with a time-series cross-sectional design for 20 OECD countries between 2000 and 2011.

Since then the resulting fears of downward mobility felt even by the middle classes have reignited the 1980's debate about a basic income. Two models (the “basic income guarantee” and the “solidarity citizen's income”) are used to discuss practical system design problems and the chances of realizing a basic income policy.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-246x.2008.00317.x,The likelihood of a basic income in Germany,https://openalex.org/W1989213081
-17.01332,-36.08242,0,"Summary It has been established that relatively high income families receive a disproportionately large share of UI benefits. Little information on the distribution of costs by income class is available, but it is quite possible that the upper income groups may also bear a disproportionately large share of the costs. More empirical research is needed before the redistributive effects of UI can be known with any degree of confidence. There is little argument about the desirability on income mainlenance grounds of extending Unemployment insurance benefits in a recessionary period, all other things being equal. U1 is quite efficient as an income maintenance tool for covered workers. With respect to the unemployment problem, though, it is feared by some that the program goes too far in maintaining the incomes of covered workers, and as a result any extension of UI benefits will aggravate the unemployment problem. The evidence presented here suggests that fears of a major increase in unemployment as a result of such changes are largely unwarranted. However, extended UI benefits would appear to have some small, nontrivial adverse impact on unemployment. Finally, it seems that UI's income distributional impact has been portrayed unjustly as pro‐rich. It may be that income is transferred through the UI system from the relatively well‐to‐do to the relatively poor. There is no scientific way of bringing these considerations to bear in deciding whether or not to restructure the unemployment insurance system. This question can be answered only by invoking fundamental value judgments to decide how sociely would be better off, and I would not presume here to offer my own. This paper will have served its purpose if it has provided the basis for a more informed decision.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-232x.1977.tb00643.x,Direct Labor Market Effects of Unemployment Insurance,https://openalex.org/W2120716811

Any financially feasible Basic Income scheme would need to alter a country’s existing tax and benefits systems, so for a genuine pilot project to take place, the country’s tax and benefits systems would have to be altered, or new taxes imposed, for a single community. It is difficult to see how this could be done in a more developed economy. To pay Basic Incomes to a community without changing existing tax and benefits systems would not constitute a pilot project; and selecting only individuals for whom the tax and benefits systems can be easily adapted, as in the Finland experiment, would not provide a representative sample, so again the experiment would not be a pilot project. A partial alternative to a physical pilot project is to create a virtual one, which microsimulation can achieve. Work on combining employment market models with microsimulation programmes is being undertaken, so it might soon be possible to create virtual pilot projects that test employment market effects.

-37.33435,-0.4006861,4,"IN 1966, the Coleman Report provided compelling evidence of the importance of the home environment in determining children's cognitive skill levels. This evidence, coupled with doubts about the effectiveness of school-based compensatory education programs, has led policymakers to consider programs that aim at improving school achievement by providing additional resources to the families of low achieving children. Efforts to design such programs have been hindered, however, by a lack of knowledge concerning the key resources in the home that influence children's achievement. This paper reports the results of research that attempts to reduce this knowledge gap by examining the roles played by particular resources in the home in influencing children's achievement. This study extends previous work on home investments in children in two significant ways. First, the analysis focuses on black children living in low income, urban families. Most previous research has studied children in middle class families. Second, the stability of the results is examined by estimating the same model for two samples of children. Previous studies have reported results for a single sample. Differences in results across studies have raised questions concerning the stability of relationships between particular home resources and children's achievement. In this study, the stability issue is addressed directly. The central finding of our research is that the skills of the mother, measured by the extent of her formal schooling, are a critical resource in determining children's achievement. Our results demonstrate that these skills affect children through the mechanism of child care, and not simply through genetically transmitted endowments. Another key result is that goods inputs in the home do not appear to have consistent effects on children's learning. Thus, our findings support the results of other recent research that has emphasized the importance of human resources (such as mothers and teachers) rather than material inputs in determining children's achievement. These and other findings are discussed in detail later in the paper. The next section of the paper lists the hypotheses examined in this study. Section III describes the analytical framework within which these hypotheses were tested. Section IV describes the data. Section V describes the problem of interpreting correlations between attributes of the home environment and children's achievement.

50.018166,-20.822142,3,"Universal basic income (UBI) is an approach to income security that guarantees every individual in a political community (be it a nation or a subnational unit such as a state, province, or municipality) an unconditional and sufficient income to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, transportation, and the other necessities of life. UBI differs from state-sponsored social insurance schemes that became widespread in welfare states during latter half of the 20th century. Social insurance is funded by mandatory employer and/or employee contributions, and is tied to specific events affecting workers, such as loss of paid employment, parenting a new child, or retirement from the labor force. UBI also differs from last-resort income support programs such as social assistance (often called “welfare” or “workfare”). Such programs are meant to respond to those in immediate and dire financial need. Qualifying for social assistance depends on proving one’s eligibility to government officials through an application process that is typically complicated, demeaning, and stigmatizing. Social assistance often requires certain behaviors of recipients, such as participation in life-skills training or (in the case of workfare) work in low-skill jobs at low pay. In contrast, UBI is available to everyone on an unconditional basis, with no requirement for advance contributions, no stigma attached to those receiving it, and no work or other behavioral requirements. The Basic Income Earth Network defines UBI in this way: “A basic income is a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement.” Basic income has the following five characteristics: (1) Periodic: paid at regular intervals (for example, every month), not as a one-off grant. (2) Cash payment: paid in an appropriate medium of exchange, allowing those who receive it to decide what they spend it on. It is not, therefore, paid either in kind (such as food or services) or in vouchers dedicated to a specific use. (3) Individual: paid on an individual basis—and not, for instance, to households. (4) Universal: paid to all, without a means test. (5) Unconditional: paid without a requirement to work or to demonstrate willingness-to-work. Basic income (or approximations thereof) often go by different names, such as guaranteed income, citizens’ income, unconditional cash transfer, refundable tax credits, or social dividend.",https://doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780195389678-0279,Universal Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W4230952041

Aiming to contribute to the current knowledge gaps and future research agendas on BI, this paper elaborates on BI theories and BI empirical cases, linkage, and gaps between these two parts. A total of 152 pieces of literature on BI theories and BI empirical cases were intensively reviewed, which includes BI definitions, positive and negative conceptual impacts of BI argued to bring to human society from social, economic, and policy-and-governance perspectives, as well as the implementation and the outcomes of 15 selected BI empirical cases. Our findings indicate that BI definitions remain imprecise, and the BI empirical cases are implemented in diverse ways. We also identified that many conceptual impacts of BI were not achieved in the reviewed BI empirical cases. We further argue that the policy environment for implementing BI has not been entirely created at present, and a key issue is that the ambiguity between the BI theories and BI empirical cases causes difficulties to generate widely agreed principles guiding the implementation of BI. This paper suggests that future studies on BI should focus more on revising existing BI definitions which need to be simplified, detailed, and unified, generating universal principles guiding the implementation of BI, and developing indicators measuring BI's consequences.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40847-021-00151-3,Review on basic income (BI): its theories and empirical cases,https://openalex.org/W3138253545

Green growth theory asserts that continued economic expansion is compatible with our planet’s ecology, as technological change and substitution will allow us to absolutely decouple GDP growth from resource use and carbon emissions. This claim is now assumed in national and international policy, including in the Sustainable Development Goals. But empirical evidence on resource use and carbon emissions does not support green growth theory. Examining relevant studies on historical trends and model-based projections, we find that: (1) there is no empirical evidence that absolute decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale against a background of continued economic growth, and (2) absolute decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough to prevent global warming over 1.5°C or 2°C, even under optimistic policy conditions.

Two progressive proposals for ending poverty and promoting personal development and freedom are then compared using this assessment criterion. The first proposal is that society guarantee everyone an unconditional basic income (BI) without imposing work requirements in exchange for the guarantee. The second proposal is that society use direct job creation to provide employment assurance (EA) for anyone who is unable to find decent work in the economy’s regular labor market. The cost of equally expansive versions of the two strategies is compared along with their ability to achieve other policy goals. It is argued that a BI guarantee would be far more expensive than the EA strategy as a means of securing the right to income recognized in the Universal Declaration, that a BI guarantee would not provide an adequate substitute for securing the right to work, and that most of the other benefits a BI guarantee would produce could be better achieved at less cost by using the EA strategy supplemented by conventional income transfer programs. Based on this analysis it is argued that efforts to promote the BI idea as a solution to the problems of unemployment and poverty in market societies should be rejected. On the other hand, less expensive versions of the BI idea could make a valuable contribution to the design of income transfer measures as long as they were not treated as a substitute for policies designed to secure the right to work and income support recognized in the Universal Declaration.

-28.979628,-5.525947,4,"The primary policy issue to which the experiment on graduated work incentives addressed itself is, of course, the effect on willingness to work. There is, however, a second category of issues, somewhat broader and less easily defined but of comparable importance, which concern the general effects of graduated work incentives on the life style of the beneficiaries. These issues can be described, in considerably oversimplified form, as follows: Those who fear the worst of a system of graduated work incentives may hold the hypothesis that a large part of the payments will be wasted by the recipients-either being spent on drugs, drinks, and gambling or being dissipated in increased leisure time unproductively used. Those espousing such an extreme view would say that a program of unconditional cash payments should be avoided, perhaps to protect the potential recipients from their own folly, and certainly to prevent the use of public funds for such purposes. At the other extreme is the view that such a program might well improve the life style of the recipients. The assurance of financial support and the increase in expected income might lead to a modification in attitudes that could, perhaps, be described as the adoption of middle-class values and a reconciliation with the goals of the bulk of society. Such attitude changes might be expected to lead, among other things, to political activity, increased interest in education and quality of neighborhoods, lower crime rates, and reduced neurosis and psychosis. At least two intermediate hypotheses also suggest themselves as possibilities. The first is that a program of graduated work incentives simply does not interfere materially with recipients' life styles, aside from augmenting spending power, and that such a measure neither can nor (perhaps) should be an effective instrument to change people's lives.

-17.751194,43.04782,5,"Through references to Hansard, official papers, Fabian pamphlets and pertinent texts from the fields of politics, sociology and social policy, this piece illustrates the similarities of thought behind the deliberations of New Labour and those of the early American functionalists and their modern‐day counterparts. Examination of the rhetoric used by both parties shows that there are three main focal points of comparison. On one level there is a shared belief in the cohesive impetus of realistic ‘aspiration’ in a stratified society. On another, there is a mutual desire to balance individual ‘rights’ with communal ‘responsibilities’. Finally, there is a common concern over the apperceived problem of the ‘underclass’ and how to deal with it. On the basis that these interrelated topics influenced social policy through the intensity of debate around them, the piece moves on to set the resultant American and British models of ‘workfare’ alongside the proposed ‘New Deals’ of New Labour. This has a threefold purpose. First, by detailing these examples the influence of the likes of Charles Murray and Lawrence Mead in future Labour policy may be observed. Second, the American association is particularly important in that the theoretical basis and practical experience of US social policy in the 1980s can act as an actual, realized example of the problems facing the proposed welfare policies of New Labour. Third, this comparison allows the piece to move on and discuss the failings of such authoritarian welfare programmes in the light of modern capitalism and modern society. In this way a conclusion on the effectiveness of New Labour and its unrealized ‘New Deal’ for Britain is broached.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9515.00221,"New Labour, Old Functionalism: The Underlying Contradictions of Welfare Reform in the US and the UK",https://openalex.org/W2121226416

Current debate on the provision of an ‘unearned’ Basic Income (BI) offers a rare opportunity to address intransigent gender pay and status gaps. Western societies’ long industrial history of paid work served to increase the established gender divide by only valuing people by their earned/owned income. There are increasingly relevant arguments for a BI as demand for paid workers diminishes. If universal, this type of payment should acknowledge the value of unpaid work time contributions, now provided mainly by women but, hopefully in the future, by more men. It would address the income inequities created by unpaid women being the main providers of services, as well as being underpaid for commercialised similar roles.

This article describes a new labour‐market specification for MONASH in which people are allocated in year t to categories according to their labourmarket activities in year t – 1. People in each category plan their labour supplies by solving an optimisation problem. Via these problems, we introduce the assumption that people in employment categories supply labour more strongly to employment activities than do people in unemployment categories. Thus we find that employment‐stimulating policies in t – 1 increase labour supply in t by shifting the composition of the labour force in t in favour of employment categories and away from unemployment categories. We illustrate this idea by using MONASH to simulate the Dawkins proposal to combine a freeze on award wage rates with tax credits for low‐wage workers in low‐income families. We find that the Dawkins policy would generate a significant short‐run increase in employment. With the increase in employment generating an increase in labour supply, the employment benefits of the policy would persist over many years. However, in the long run, we would expect the effect of the policy on aggregate employment to be small and to depend on how the policy affected the ratio of real after‐tax wage rates to unemployment benefits.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8462.00265,A New Specification of Labour Supply in the MONASH Model with an Illustrative Application,https://openalex.org/W3121181961

Yet some groups have lost and suffered far more than others during the process of production and wealth creation, due to colonization, slavery and expropriation. This article argues that calls for reparations are an important caveat to the universalist case for distributive justice. It does so by examining three cases for reparations: reparations for slavery, for transnational inequalities generated by European colonization, and for the dispossession of Indigenous peoples by settler colonialism. The authors put these three cases in dialogue with the argument for universalist (re)distribution, in particular the contention that a universal but redistributory rightful share could act as redress for the unjust expropriation and wealth accumulation of capitalism. This article thus demarcates the overlaps and tensions between reparatory justice and distributory justice, underscoring both the intersection and the friction between calls for redistribution on universal lines and variegated forms of redistribution plus recognition.",https://doi.org/10.1111/dech.12695,Reparations as a Rightful Share: From Universalism to Redress in Distributive Justice,https://openalex.org/W3215343606

Marx’s critique of exploitation suggests two apparently opposed positions on a basic income. On the one hand, a basic income funded from taxes on labor would appear to be exploitative of workers. On the other hand, a basic income liberates everyone from the vulnerable condition in which one is forced to sell one’s labor in order to survive, and so seems to be one way of abolishing exploitation at its root. This paper will develop a conception of exploitation that resolves the conflict in favor of basic income. The conception of exploitation is grounded in a liberal egalitarian conception of justice rather than in Marx’s labor theory of value or an exclusive focus on the worker-capitalist relation. This position is not premised on an acceptance of the basic institutions of capitalism, but rather is a standpoint from which to evaluate them. It is not necessary to downsize our ideas of freedom and equality. But it is less obvious than it appeared in classic Marxist formulations that socialism is necessary for social justice.

However, to assess the financial feasibility of basic income, it is also important to consider how much basic income will cost in the future. This is especially important in countries experiencing an ageing population, where the proportion of workers is expected to shrink. This article considers basic income as a universal life annuity and develops two models based on actuarial concepts to estimate the flat tax rate required to finance basic income. The first model considers the cost of basic income over the lifetime of the current population and the second model additionally considers changing population dynamics. The proposed models are conceptually simple, providing a straightforward way to assess the financial feasibility of basic income. Using Singapore data, the models show that the monthly cut-off income separating net contributors and net recipients is around $2710 and benefits around 39 % of adult residents.

This article explores how such policy ideals can operate with a racialised impact in the context of income management, a type of welfare conditionality in Australia that delivers cashless welfare transfers. Income management originally applied only to Indigenous welfare recipients, but has since been expanded. The government’s rationale for the scheme is to limit access to alcohol and other drugs, and promote ‘socially responsible behaviour’. However, empirical evidence indicates that income management in the Northern Territory has not been successful in achieving the government’s policy objectives.

-49.078884,4.6294775,1,"There is a long-standing debate in academic and policymaking circles about the normative merits and economic effects of a universal basic income (UBI). However, existing literature does not sufficiently address the question of which factors are associated with individual support for a UBI. While a large literature in political economy has focused on individual preferences for existing welfare state benefits, it has not analysed the case of a UBI. Using the eighth wave of the European Social Survey (ESS), this article seeks to remedy this gap by analysing individual support for a UBI in 21 European countries. The findings from logistic regression analyses with country fixed effects are partly consistent with the expectations of previous social policy and political economy literatures. Younger, low-income, left-leaning individuals and the unemployed are more likely to support a UBI. Individuals with positive views of benefit recipients and/or high trust in political institutions are also more supportive, while anti-immigration attitudes are associated with lower support. By contrast, the patterns across occupations are mixed and male respondents appear slightly more supportive. Trade union membership is not statistically significant, perhaps because of contradictory effects: unions typically support new welfare state policies but they also have a key role in many existing welfare state schemes and may worry about individuals’ attachment to the labour market. At the cross-national level, support tends to be higher where benefit activation is more pronounced and unemployment benefits less generous. These results suggest one possible reason why countries with high support for a UBI have not introduced it: the mixed support among the left means a pro-UBI coalition has to draw on right-wing voters who may support it only with lower taxes and/or extensive replacement of welfare state benefits, which in turn may further alienate parts of the left.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0958928720923596,The political economy of individual-level support for the basic income in Europe,https://openalex.org/W3015310819

11.683544,8.524475,5,"Unconditional basic income is not a new topic in political economy, and it gains new momentum as more and more research is being devoted to it. The discussion focusses on the adequacy and effects such a policy measure may entail for a person and his socio-economic situation, usually. Object of investigation is the individual, and the corresponding theory is of micro-economic descent. In this paper, in contrast, we develop a method of how to assess feasibility and consequences of an unconditional basic income for a modern, open economy, on the macroeconomic level, using concepts and statistics of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) as our main tool. A SAM-based approach can measure, and perhaps model, the impact on the economic activity of a country, and on its economic institutions of new policy measures such as introducing an unconditional basic income. 
The economic activity of a country is expressed in monetary flows as registered in the National Accounts. So their underlying principles and definitions are adopted. However, the habitual way of putting an economy into a sequence of institutional accounts connecting each institution’s income to the cost, - similar to business accounting - reveals only one, namely the inner-institutional half of the economic circuit. The other, outer half, namely, how the costs of one institution generate income for another one is better captured by the format of a Social Accounting Matrix. In the paper, the impact of an unconditional basic income is quantified, for macroeconomic aggregates of institutional sectors and socio-economic groups of households, taking the German and the Portuguese economies as examples. Purpose of the paper is not to argue for, or against, an unconditional basic income, but to offer a scientific tool with which to calculate and assess possibilities and consequences of the proposal, for a national economy as a whole.",,Unconditional Basic Income: Who gets it?

Even though the pragmatics of everyday life as an aggregate underlie the bulk of environmental impacts, these insidious impacts impose little immediate influence on everyday life, in particular in the urban Global North.

The unconditional basic income in the form of a negative income tax is therefore discussed and tentatively developed. It is suggested that the negative income tax should be granted unconditionally and individually to all legal and permanent residents without the obligation of services in return. Besides the negative lump sum tax, a lump sum supplement should be granted for caregivers, honorary workers and people incapable of working. Based on a person’s own income a positive tax should be counted against the negative income tax. With the implementation of the suggested model of a negative income tax, basic (financial) needs could be secured and the tax and transfer system could be harmonized, whereby administration effort could be reduced and poverty traps avoided. It is stressed that for the implementation of a comprehensive model of a negative income tax all relevant parameters as well as possible impacts need to be investigated cautiously; suggestions of this thesis therefore need to be seen as a first attempt.

The contributions to this book have amply shown this to be true. But writing any sort of book on social security is a risky undertaking. When we reflected earlier on the last edition of this book (published in 2009), we noted that it was rooted in the political and economic circumstances at the time. Successive Labour governments from 1997 had maintained consistent policy aims for over a decade – to reduce poverty, especially child poverty, and to promote paid employment – that it pursued through a variety of means, including, but not only, the social security system. But we were not to know as the book was being prepared in 2008 that the global economic and financial systems on which the generally prosperous first decade of this century was built were about to come crashing down.

To this end, we use a simple agent-based model to examine the impact of a specific guaranteed income policy on changes in wealth distribution.

We then compare the performance indicators with the baseline model to see how they change when each policy model is implemented.BR In conclusion, we found that any income guarantee policy has the effect of correcting the distribution of wealth in the existing economy, but in particular, “broad welfare for the underprivileged” and “universal basic income” are the policies that equalize the distribution of wealth and make it converge to a normal distribution. These two policies had the effect of shifting the distribution of wealth from an exponential distribution of the base model to a normal distribution, and led to improvements in metrics such as the top decile share and the Gini coefficient.",https://doi.org/10.7737/kmsr.2023.40.4.067,An Analysis of Impact of Income Transfer Policies on Wealth Distribution using Agent-Based Models,https://openalex.org/W4390718450

INTRODUCTION This paper examines factors that have contributed to a new social envi- ronment which places lower priorities on equalizing minority opportunities; the impact of that environment on governmental policies that contributed to the 1981 recession and increased minority income differences; and the impli- cations of the effects of current decisions on the future economic well-being of minorities. Suggestions are offered for changing this new environment, and for the development of more appropriate governmental policies for re- ducing income differences. The environment for public decisions is strongly influenced by continuing confusion between the progress of working minori- ties and the lack of progress of minorities as a group. This mistake has con- tributed to the majority belief that minority economic progress has been rapid and will automatically continue as a result of built-in features of this society. In addition, the willful actions of the government in contributing to the 1981 recession are briefly examined and the available recourse of minorities in a majority society is considered. Reagonomics as an approach to reduc- ing future minority income differences is examined and alternatives offered in terms of governmental, and minority community actions. Higher levels of output, which has only been produced by close govern- mental and private enterprise cooperation, is a necessary condition for dis- turbing existing social consensus on the role of minorities and is a prerequisite to closing the income gap. It is argued that a more favorable environment must be based on the majority realizing the advantages of fully utilizing the unused resources of the minority community. The imperatives of international economic competition are making it increasingly difficult to inefficiently used minority resources. Moreover, growing international com- petition is strongest in those industries which employ large numbers of mi- nority workers. Future improvement will be even more difficult because the cumulative effect of past efforts to reduce discrimination have not produced significant improvements in the income ratio in more progressive regions, urban areas or industries. The improvement has been achieved by minorities shifting to more favorable regions, industries and occupations; by converging produc- tive characteristics; and by reductions in the more flagrant discriminatory practices.

This sounds like illiberal privilege, or at least it cannot be a coercively enforceable claim. I argue, however, that the right to strike is justified as a way of resisting intertwined forms of structural and personal domination associated with the modern labor market. Workers are structurally dominated insofar as being forced to make a contract with some employer or another leaves them vulnerable to exploitation. They are personally dominated insofar as they are required to submit to the arbitrary authority of managers in the workplace, which deepens their potential exploitation. Strikes contest this domination by reversing the relationship of power.

1.8874389,23.8036,1,"Proponents recommend Universal Basic Income as a solution to a trifold crisis of work, wage and social democracy. Synthesising Marxian form analysis with Marxist-feminist social reproduction theory, this article suggests that these crises relate to historically specific capitalist social forms: labour, money and the state. These separate but interlocking crises of social form are temporary and contingent expressions of an underlying, permanent crisis of social reproduction. Mistaking the pervasive crisis of social reproduction in its totality for a temporary or contingent trifold crisis of work, wage or social democracy, Universal Basic Income proposals seek to solve it by moving through the same social forms through which they take effect, rather than confronting the social relations that constitute their antagonistic undertow and generate the crisis of social reproduction. The article considers two other solutions proposed to handle the deeper-rooted crisis with which Universal Basic Income grapples: Universal Basic Services and Universal Basic Infrastructure. Both propose non-monetary ways past the impasses of the Universal Basic Income, addressing much more directly the constrained basis of individual and collective reproduction that characterises capitalist social relations. But they retain a link with capitalist social forms of money and state that may serve to close rather than open the path to real alternatives. The article concludes that the contradictions these ‘abstract universals’ touch upon are best mediated through more bottom-up and struggle-based ‘concrete universals’ that address the manifold crises of work, wage and social democracy that undergird them. Such alternatives would leave open dynamic tensions around work and welfare in contemporary capitalism without promise of their incomplete resolution in the name of a false universality unattainable in a world characterised by antagonism, domination and crisis.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0309816819873323,"Social form, social reproduction and social policy: Basic income, basic services, basic infrastructure",https://openalex.org/W2953669738
-25.049324,-5.2165546,4,"Over the past forty years, income growth for the middle and lower classes has stagnated, while the economy (and with it, economic inequality) has grown significantly. Early automation, the decline of labor unions, changes in corporate taxation, the financialization and globalization of the economy, deindustrialization in the U.S. and many OECD countries, and trade have contributed to these trends. However, the transformative roles of more recent automation and digital technologies/artificial intelligence (AI) are now considered by many as additional and potentially more potent forces undermining the ability of workers to maintain their foothold in the economy. These drivers of change are intensifying the extent to which advancing technology imbedded in increasingly productive real capital is driving productivity. To compound the problem, many solutions presented by industrialized nations to environmental problems rely on hyper-efficient technologies, which if fully implemented, could further advance the displacement of well-paid job opportunities for many. While there are numerous ways to address economic inequality, there is growing interest in using some form of universal basic income (UBI) to enhance income and provide economic stability. However, these approaches rarely consider the potential environmental impact from the likely increase in aggregate demand for goods and services or consider ways to focus this demand on more sustainable forms of consumption. Based on the premise that the problems of income distribution and environmental sustainability must be addressed in an integrated and holistic way, this paper considers how a range of approaches to financing a UBI system, and a complementary market solution based on an ownership-broadening approach to inclusive capitalism, might advance or undermine strategies to improve environmental sustainability.",,Universal basic income and inclusive capitalism: consequences for sustainability,https://openalex.org/W3094136743

The risks of this process were treated only as side effects. However, the pursuit of profit is now globalizing risk.

A simultaneous equations model of the labour market is specified and estimated by a procedure that accounts for the simultaneous equations nature of the model and for the possibility of sample selection bias. The major empirical findings are that wages net of child care costs rather than gross wages determine the supply of hours. Total unearned income and for married women the husband's gross wage have a negative influence on hours supplied. The presence of young children also has a negative influence, but children between six and fifteen years of age apparently do not.

The model illustrates that ‘working’ can be as much a source of utility as ‘leisure activities’. The dependency of the budget situation on choices is outlined and the issue of the crowding out of activities in the unpaid sphere is formalized in the model.

-18.961798,20.161898,4,"Abstract The political economy literature has gathered compelling evidence that labour market risks shape political preferences. Accordingly, insecurity fuels support for redistribution and left parties. This article analyses this argument for temporary workers, a so far neglected risk category which has increased dramatically in the past two decades. Temporary workers also have been in the focus of recent insider‐outsider debates. Some authors in this line of research have argued that temporary work leads to political disenchantment – for example, non‐instrumental responses such as vote abstention or protest voting. This contradicts risk‐based explanations of political preferences. The article discusses both theoretical perspectives and derives conflicting hypotheses for the empirical analysis of temporary workers' policy and party preferences. The review reveals considerable ambiguity regarding the questions which parties temporary workers can be expected to support and what the underlying motives for party choice are. Synthesising arguments from both perspectives, the article proposes an alternative argument according to which temporary workers are expected to support the ‘new’ left – that is, green and other left‐libertarian parties. It is argued that this party family combines redistributive policies with outsider‐friendly policy design. Using individual‐level data from the European Social Survey for 15 European countries, the article supports this argument by showing that temporary, compared to permanent, workers exhibit higher demand for redistribution and stronger support for the new left. Neither the risk‐based nor the insider‐outsider explanations receive full support. In particular, no signs of political disenchantment of temporary workers can be found. Thus, the findings challenge central claims of the insider‐outsider literature.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12027,Labour market risks and political preferences: The case of temporary employment,https://openalex.org/W1580942943

20.593502,1.7913537,2,"24 | International Union Rights | 27/3 FOCUS | IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON WORK AND THE CHALLENGE FOR UNION RIGHTS Universal Basic Income – not really an alternative The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) sounds intriguing at first: everyone should be guaranteed an income which covers their basic needs. Who would argue with that? Taking a closer look, however, there is much uncertainty as to what exactly is meant and how a UBI should work and be financed. This was also evident during the Covid 19 pandemic, when proposals were made to use a temporary basic income to cushion the economic consequences for the population and especially its particularly vulnerable sections. For example a study for the United Nations Development Programme proposed this for the world’s three billion poorest people. But this would be neither universal nor sufficient – in average US$ 2.50 per person per day. In the paper there is also a positive reference to Spain, where a ‘basic income’ was introduced. There it concerns however an even worse Spanish variant of the German model of basic security for needy unemployed (‘Hartz IV’), which is criticised by the trade unions as too low and too repressive. UBI as a rescue against the crisis? For Germany this discussion makes little sense. This is a country with a highly developed social welfare system, which showed its performance in the ongoing crisis – despite of all problems and legitimate criticisms. This system is characterised by social insurance schemes, which involve the vast majority of the population – in particular, dependent employees and their families – which provide benefits on the basis of contributions paid. Especially, the short-time work allowance saved millions from falling into unemployment. But nevertheless many mini-jobbers, self-employed and small entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit. They often have low incomes anyway and need every euro, but do not receive short-time work benefits or unemployment benefits because they are not covered by unemployment insurance. If they are needy, they can apply for basic security, but this is below the German poverty line. For the German UBI community this is rather a deterrent example, they see a ‘real UBI’ as the fundamental alternative to this means-tested basic provision. A UBI as they mean it is intended to be an income that the government pays unconditionally to each person, regardless of what income that person receives or what assets they possess. There is no means testing and each person receives the same amount (only children less). The UBI should be high enough to cover basic needs and guarantee social participation. The search for gainful employment would not be required. As a response to the Covid 19 crisis more than 400,000 people supported a petition that demands the introduction of an unconditional basic income of 800-1200 euro per person and month in Germany for 6 months. This would cost about 500 billion euro, which would be 3 or 4 times the complete public expenditure on education. But why should everyone receive such an unconditional basic income (BGE) as a measure against the crisis, although for many, fortunately the majority of employees, the income is not at all lost, but continues as before? For the majority of the employees hit by the crisis the short-time work allowance or even the unemployment benefit is better than such a UBI would be. On the other hand, such an UBI would not be a rescue for the many self-employed and small businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy because their income is lost but they still have to pay various running costs, rents, etc. Targeted aid for those who need it would also make more economic sense so that they can get started again after the crisis. And this would be far less expensive because far fewer people than the entire population would receive it. Arguments against demands for a UBI In principle, the various arguments that speak against a UBI also apply to a corona crisis UBI. Why should the vast majority of the population receive this money, although they do not need it at all? Why should everyone get the same amount, no matter how high their...",https://doi.org/10.14213/inteuniorigh.27.3.0024,Universal Basic Income - not really an alternative,https://openalex.org/W3094176600
18.961617,5.251781,0,"A commonly heard proposal in academic and policy circles alike is for the introduction of an obligation for all Member States to guarantee a dignified minimum income to their citizens. The accelerated integration that has taken place over the past two decades, the consistent and repeated presence of the necessity of adequate minimum income protection in European political discourse, and the EU2020 poverty targets strongly suggest that, if a decisive step is ever made towards binding measures in the field of social security, then it is quite likely to involve arrangements regarding minimum incomes. In this article we consider the impact of the introduction of such an arrangement at the European level. We identify four obstacles to overcome. First is the uncertainty over the most appropriate way of defining an adequate minimum income. Secondly, the budgetary burden of raising social assistance benefits would be quite substantial, especially in the poorer Member States. Thirdly, improving minimum income protection for the unemployed would generate significant unemployment traps. Finally, it is argued that the legal, and especially the political, feasibility of a Directive on Minimum Income that would be legally binding for the Member States remains highly uncertain. We therefore conclude that, given the great heterogeneity between countries, any binding instrument on minimum income will have to be worded flexibly, introduced gradually, and implemented in unison with a convergence in activation measures and minimum wages. Arguably, in this context, priority should be given to measures aimed at covering the minimum costs of child-rearing, restricted in an initial phase to guaranteeing to all families with children an income equal to 40 per cent of median standardised income.",https://doi.org/10.1177/138826271101300404,Towards Minimum Income Protection in Europe: Budgetary and Political Obstacles to Overcome,https://openalex.org/W2594682398

Since the Industrial Revolution, the prospect of unlimited growth with the aim of jobs creation has been dramatically associated with a massive social-ecological degradation that puts the Earth system at risk. In recent decades, a number of heterodox theories and policies are reconsidering our relationship with work in view of contemporaneous social-ecological challenges. This paper offers critical review of five contrasting approaches. Those promoting ‘green jobs’ consider the possibility of transforming ecological constraints into economic opportunities by incentivising eco-efficient innovations and generating new jobs.

In addition to rationales that relate to fairness and response to structural employment shifts due to automation and globalization, another motivation that is sometimes put forward for these plans is to encourage risk-taking by providing a safety net: There would be greater entrepreneurial activity if an unsuccessful entrepreneur had the GBI to fall back on. In this paper we investigate a rare long-standing example similar to a GBI in the US: the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend program. This was not put forth as a GBI, and the annual amount is too small to allow an individual to rely fully on these funds; but for a moderate-to-large family the APF can replace a large share of a poverty-level income. Receipt of the APF also does not preclude a family from receiving other safety net benefits—food stamps, unemployment compensation—which suggests that the downside risk for a potential entrepreneur may be lower than in other US states. We initially examine trends in small-firm births in Alaska over time from the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics 1977–2014—before and after the institution of the APF program (the first payment was in 1982)—relative to other US states to investigate a possible impact on entrepreneurship; the results suggest a positive effect—which appears to dissipate over time.

The most important objection to this argument available to Rawlsians is that basic income violates the demands of reciprocity, where reciprocity in any scheme of distribution is a requirement of justice.

Trade unions have championed these apparently pro-poor policies, even though the trade union movement is not a movement of the poor in South Africa (there are very few union members in the poorest half of the population). Trade unions' record in acting as a movement for the poor is shaped by their primary objective of looking after their members' interests. In education, teachers and unions engage with the state as the employer more than as the provider of a social service. Teachers' unions were primarily responsible for securing more expenditure on poor schools in the mid-1990s, but this was the result of increased salaries. Self-interest has led teachers and their unions to oppose, block or impede some reforms that would improve the quality of schooling for poor children. In welfare reform, trade unions have championed the cause of the basic income grant, which is in the interests of the poor. A close analysis suggests that organised labour is also acting here in part out of self-interest. The socialisation of welfare costs will reduce the burden on working people and would deflect criticism of union-backed policies that, arguably, contribute to an economic growth path characterised by high wages but low employment.

The expenses of the redistribution pertaining to basic goods, as well as those associated with public (non-basic) but vital goods, are separately estimated by transforming the expenses into functions of the poverty line. The findings reveal that, along the poverty line that treats all citizens equally, the politicians representing opposing ideologies decide how the redistribution of basic and vital goods should be financed. Politicians should come to an agreement, subject to an approval of their decisions by voters-citizens. However, in the absence of such approval, politicians have no alternative but to continue the negotiations.

This paper examines the potential tradeoffs between targeting these transfers towards low income households versus providing universal cash transfers, also known as a Universal Basic Income. We start by discussing how the fact that most households in poor countries do not pay income taxes changes how we conceptually think about Universal Basic Incomes. We then analyze data from two countries, Indonesia and Peru, to document the tradeoffs involved. The results suggest that, despite the imperfections in targeting using proxy-means tests, targeted transfers may result in substantially higher welfare gains than universal programs, because for a given total budget they deliver much higher transfers to the poor. On the other hand, targeted transfers do lead to more horizontal equity violations, and do create an implied tax on consumption in the region where benefits are phased out. We discuss how alternative targeting approaches, such as community-targeting and self-targeting, can be used to further improve targeting in some situations.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3242291,Universal Basic Incomes vs. Targeted Transfers: Anti-Poverty Programs in Developing Countries,https://openalex.org/W3154315416

To do this, we first estimate a structural labor supply model using the existing tax code and predict the labor supply of a representative sample of individuals based upon the parameter estimates of the model.Simulations show that the original recommendation would have strong negative impacts on participation rates of low-earners and that its cost would exceed $ 2 billion. Increasing the hours cut-off is predicted to have little impact beyond those of the original recommendation. Providing a guaranteed income equivalent to 100% of the MBM, on the other hand, would have a large impact.

I answer this question with a quantitative model to assess the general equilibrium, inequality, and welfare effects of substituting the current US income security system with a universal basic income (UBI) policy. To do so, I develop an overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic income risk that incorporates intensive and extensive margins of the labor supply, on-the-job learning, and child-bearing costs. The tax-transfer system closely mimics the US design. I calibrate the model to the US economy and conduct counterfactual analyses that implement reforms toward a UBI. I find that an expenditure-neutral reform has moderate impacts on agents’ labor supply response but induces aggregate capital and output to grow due to larger precautionary savings. A UBI of $1,000 monthly requires a substantial increase in the tax rate of consumption used to clear the government budget and leads to an overall decrease in the macroeconomic aggregates, stemming from a drop in the labor supply. In both cases, the economy has more equally distributed disposable income and consumption.

It finds that the telling and sharing of hopeful and positive stories were central both to the way basic income was expressed within the community, and to the advocacy work done around it, which sought to challenge long-standing narratives about poverty and work.

Growth takes place in terms of monetary flows, financial assets and transactions, capital accumulation; in terms of aggregate material throughput, infrastructure, desires, efficiency and productivity. It is equally promoted by those who call for austerity as well as those who advocate Keynesianism. The final result is often the same. Problems are shifted in space and time. The growth fetish, however, will not go away by ignoring it, but by creating the necessary political, social and economic conditions for managing and living well without growth.

While it denounces GDP growth, its focus lies on changing the context and the units of measurement, or reference. The thorny goal of reducing consumption within degrowth is driven by principles of political organization in the spirit of caring for the commons, voluntary simplicity, and conviviality. Our hypothesis is that there is little to lose from embarking on a degrowth trajectory. On the contrary, only by dropping the growth fetish (now) can emissions be stabilized and extreme events prevented from menacing livelihoods.

This article uses narratives and observations gathered in social movement ‘free spaces’, autonomous social centres in Barcelona, to evaluate, critique and rearticulate the concept. Participants' attention to the ‘means’ through which protest is carried out and emphasis on projects such as experimentation with alternative social and organisational forms suggest they engage in prefigurative politics.

This combination of factors has led some analysts to explore new ways to deliver welfare state benefits, or reconfigure them. But others speculate that existing welfare state policies have run their course, and cannot be easily repaired to cope with these multiple challenges, especially in the face of slower and less labor-intensive economic growth. Some advocates are calling for introducing a universal basic income (UBI), either as a floor to provide a basic level of subsistence, as a complement to existing welfare state policies, or in some cases as a replacement for the welfare state. Much of the current interest in UBI stems from a belief that technology is rapidly eliminating jobs faster than new ones can be created, and future job growth will be much lower. But the evidence on technological displacement seems too uncertain to justify major disruptions in the welfare state. Rather, the UBI debate might better focus on the over thirty-year strengthening of business’ economic power relations over labor.",https://doi.org/10.7312/ocam18544-017,14.

In a broad sense, epistemic equality describes the idea that every individual has an equal right to speak up and to be heard if she has relevant information or knowledge to share, questions to ask, or complaints to bring forward. Epistemic equality has moral, instrumental, and instrumentally moral value in organizations. Drawing on Miranda Fricker’s work on epistemic injustice (2009), I argue that we have good reasons to postulate epistemic equality as a normative ideal for organizations, even if – and precisely because – they are otherwise hierarchically structured. The hypothesis I then proceed to explore is that an unconditional basic income, by providing better opportunities for “exit”, might be a step that would strengthen epistemic equality in organizations.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0009,Basic Income and the Ideal of Epistemic Equality,https://openalex.org/W2409180888

Fiscal financing of UBI would namely request a much larger European “federal” budget financed by a specific European tax or by participation of the “federation” on some of the existing tax bases, and by agreed upon allotment of the accumulated “federal” fiscal revenues. Though ensuing redistribution of GDP would be relatively modest, the European UBI without an alternative to the tax revenues requirements remains illusionary. Helicopter money (HM) replacing quantitative easing (QE) might provide such an alternative. Modalities of its implementation differ and the idea raises questions of its compliance with the legal regime of the ECB and opens many other topics such as the effectiveness of “QE for the people” and its long-run consequences.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2016-0021,Universal Basic Income and Helicopter Money,https://openalex.org/W2753991585

There are several ways in which governments can create fiscal space to finance social protection programmes (e.g. social pensions). The idea is to create new sources of revenue –sustainable in the long-run – which can be used to finance social pensions, without building new liabilities and without distorting macroeconomic stability. The literature specifically addressing the potential fiscal space that could be created to finance social pensions is limited.

Specifically, examine the potential funding power of three types of taxes (income tax, corporate tax, and trade tax) using cross-country tax revenues and tax rate data in a global perspective.

We develop a simple macroeconomic setup in which the social planner determines how to optimally intervene, through income taxation, in order to minimize the social cost, inclusive of infection and economic costs, of the spread of an epidemic disease. The disease lowers economic production and thus income by reducing the size of the labor force employed in productive activities, tightening thus the economy's overall resources constraint. We consider a framework in which the planner uses the collected tax revenue to intervene in either prevention (aimed at reducing the rate of infection) or treatment (aimed at increasing the speed of recovery). Both optimal prevention and treatment policies allow the economy to achieve a disease-free equilibrium in the long run but their associated costs are substantially different along the transitional dynamic path. By quantifying the social costs associated with prevention and treatment we determine which policy is most cost-effective under different circumstances, showing that prevention (treatment) is desirable whenever the infectivity rate is low (high).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2020.03.005,Optimal control of prevention and treatment in a basic macroeconomic–epidemiological model,https://openalex.org/W3019423336

However, it offers a choice to the households between two different welfare schemes whichever is more suitable for their specific situation. Furthermore, the new proposal is based on a clear and transparent ethical foundation that is inspired by the Catholic social teaching.The chapter starts with an explanation of the German concept of subsistence level as the lower bound of social welfare payments in Germany. The proposed basic income scheme is explained afterwards. The focus is especially on the build-in choice option as tax units can choose between two different tax-and-transfer schemes. In addition, the proposal includes a new approach to child support which results in higher child-related benefits as in the prevalent scheme.

32.172745,-6.292589,2,"1. Basic Income: what are we talking about?The idea of   Basic Income grant to provide for fundamental life needs dates back   long time in the history of the broader ius existentiae debate (Bronzini, 2011). Basic Income sits in the debate concerning the historical issue of wealth redistribution, rather in the discussion about the allocation of that amount of affluence generated by   determined social order, in   specific historical time. Indeed, we will see how Basic Income focuses directly on the relationship between social and productive organization, which is at the heart of the capitalist contemporary mainstream development model (Gorz, 2009).A first attempt to summarize this historical debate and to equip research of   commonly shared definition of Basic Income has been led by the philosopher Philippe Van Parijs and the political scientist Yannick Vanderborght. In their book, L'Allocation Universelle, they not only rebuild   thoroughly genesis of the principle of ius ad vitam, but they also refine what is today the most notorious explanation of Basic Income: a revenue paid individually by   political community to all its members, without   means test and working requirements (Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2005, trad. it. 2006:5). However, despite this first conceptual framing, which at first glance appears to undermine the social stratification basis in terms of material and symbolic rewards, it is still missing   deeper level of specification to clarify the following issues: How much does Basic Income amount to? Who are the exact targets? Is it   distributive or re-distributive measure? The extraordinary multitude of approaches and methods employed throughout time to identify the mechanisms of wealth creation have led to   great confusion in the definition of what   Basic Income is and how it should work.To this day, there has been   partial attempt to shed light on the fragmented terminology in the final report of the   Parlamentare per l'analisi delle compatibilita macroeconomiche della spesa sociale (so called Commissione Onofri, Roma, 1997)1. Here, the Italian sociologists Chiara Saraceno and Maurizio Ferrera have tried to outline some pathways, addressed to the national Italian government, that will provide for   direct support to individual income. In spite of that, together with Greece, Italy is still today the only European country lacking   national-net of income support. Saraceno and Ferrera have sketched out   distinction among some of the most employed terms for individual cash transfers: Basic Income, Citizenship Income, Guaranteed Minimum income, Insertion Income and Last Resort income. However, we are still lacking   careful taxonomy of the several measures calling for   cash transfer and of the resulting levels of social protection.The whole redistributive debate orbits around two main phenomenological axes: the crisis of the fordist labour and the crisis of the related welfare system (Sennet 2006, Rifkin 2002, Fraser-Honnet 2003, Paci 2007, De Masi 1999, Mantegna-Tiddi 1997). Therefore, we must interpose the research on the Basic Income idea between the passing of the wage society and the overcoming of the charitable state (Accornero 1997, Paci 2007, Fumagalli, 1997b). For this reason, in this review I will go over the main literature dealing with the idea of Basic Income. First, I will try to outline   brief historical bibliography about the issue of ius existentiae. Secondly, I will provide an empirical picture of the experiences of such   monetary transfer. Thirdly, I will depict   general map of the socio-economic approaches to Basic Income in the contemporary redistributive debate. In conclusion, I will attempt to point out   possible research direction.2.

Since 1982, all Alaskan residents have been entitled to a yearly cash dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund. Using data from the Current Population Survey and a synthetic control method, we show that the dividend had no effect on employment, and increased part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent). Although theory and prior empirical research suggests that individual cash transfers decrease household labor supply, we interpret our results as evidence that general equilibrium effects of widespread and permanent transfers tend to offset this effect, at least on the extensive margin. Consistent with this story, we show suggestive evidence that tradable sectors experience employment reductions, while non-tradable sectors do not.

Such utopian thinking is indispensable, and contributing to it is part of sociology’s core business. This article illustrates these claims by considering one particular utopian proposal: an unconditional basic income paid to every member of society on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It summarizes the main arguments that support this proposal, mentions a number of contexts in which it is being taken seriously, and sketches a number of ways in which sociological insights and research are crucially relevant to the discussion of the economic and political sustainability of an unconditional basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329213483106,The Universal Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W2162352974

Yet, in other ways, such as its focus on individual rights and responsibility, the U.S. system is unique.The article begins by discussing the nine guiding principles of the U.S. Social Security system as identified by the late Robert Ball. It then describes the principal elements of employment-based pension plans in the U.S and provides a brief overview of individual savings.

What Beveridge achieved was the introduction of a comprehensive system of national insurance that provided national minimum provision for the range of different needs arising from disrupted earnings, namely basic pensions, sickness, unemployment, maternity, widows and industrial injuries benefits. Alongside this, other universal services for basic needs were established in health, family allowances and education. In implementing Beveridge, the 1945–51 Labour government established a welfare state responsible for providing minimum provision for basic needs. In so doing, it gave the fullest expression to the Social Democratic belief that the purpose of social policy was to contribute to human fulfilment by meeting basic needs.",https://doi.org/10.1057/9780333982433_3,Equality and Difference in the Postwar Years,https://openalex.org/W2528945854

In Finland, this phenomenon was experienced as a rough time later—at the beginning of the 1990s—when unemployment jumped almost to half a million (about 15.5 percent). Governments tried to relieve the consequences of unemployment and poverty by providing social benefits conditionally and, in so far as in their power, to take employment-promoting measures. Although unemployment is no longer massive, structural and long-term unemployment still exists. It is difficult for governments and political leaders to rethink the changes in the economy and working life. Although the nature of work has changed, almost all benefits are somehow connected with paid work. In addition, the concept of work/labor itself has to be redefined. At least the relation between work and basic livelihood needs a new definition. A major problem is that the social security system in welfare states, for instance in Finland and Nordic countries, is very complicated and leads to poverty and other traps.

Among the shortcomings, the following can be distinguished: high cost, probable loss of motivation by citizens to work, impossibility to eliminate the fundamental causes of inequality with the help of UBI. Examples of the implementation of UBI in developed, developing countries, and countries with emerging markets are given. The current socio-economic situation in Ukraine is characterized, taking into account the influence of endogenous and exogenous negative factors, the consequences of the full-scale Russian invasion, in particular the loss of territories with significant deposits of natural resources and powerful industrial potential, mass migration of the population, etc. Our state is currently unable to use its powerful economic potential. An analysis of the expenditures of the State Budget of Ukraine for 2023 on social protection and pension provision of the population was carried out. It is proposed to introduce the UBI in Ukraine as a reliable tool of social protection with the use of international aid funds (during martial law) and rent payments as sources of its payment. It is concluded that the payment of UBI will increase the level of trust in the state and reduce corruption, as citizens will have less need to receive additional income outside the tax system and state support programs.",https://doi.org/10.33763/npndfi2023.01.005,Prospects for the implementation of unconditional basic income in Ukraine (part 2),https://openalex.org/W4386588650

While each transaction may seem commonplace, when timebanks flourish they work to reshape motivations and opportunities for engaging in labor, and relocalize networks of solidarity, friendship, and resources. Participants reported examples of developing unexpected friendships and renewed enthusiasm for a larger collective project of building alternatives to the currently dominant growth-addicted economic model. These processes contribute to the establishment of foundational, mostly small-scale networks that are enjoyable to use in the here and now, while also creating the potential for these systems to be scaled up or linked together in response to greater economic, ecological, and social changes.

Today, although this approach has become prevalent in many middle-income economies, its conceptual and practical application has not been studied in detail outside of high-income countries. This paper conceptualizes, for the first time, the implementation of integrated approaches, focusing on low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We first develop a conceptual framework to understand how integrated policies can address labour market challenges, exploring the theoretical effects they exert on selected labour market and social dimensions. We then contrast these theoretical expectations with findings from the empirical literature on the effectiveness of integrated approaches. While many empirical studies find positive effects across different labour market dimensions, this is not a universal finding. To reconcile this discrepancy, we investigate the design and implementation of integrated approaches across LMIC and identify factors which contribute to their effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2023.2246621,Why Should we Integrate Income and Employment Support?

Th e following paper is an essay that seeks to grasp the political economic meaning and implications of the propositions related to helicopter money and basic income. We cannot avoid observing the essence of these proposals, presented fundamentally as a distribution-related issue, in the historical context of value, work and money creation. Helicopter money appears in this light as a new paradigm of extensive growth, which at fi rst glance comes off as a fi nancial innovation, but paradoxically rather bears a relationship with a pre-capitalist conception of value. Moreover, helicopter money is a wage-substitute transfer that does not respond to the social and symbolic void that has replaced work. It appears to be a welfare instrument, while it can only rest on the separation of production and consumption on a global scale. Helicopter money is an extension of quantitative easing by other means, which unveils the motives for money creation.

Wiles concluded his witty comparative assessment of Soviet and American employment trends by vouching for ‘the superiority of the Soviet system, even when there is full employment in the USA’.1 This conclusion, however, ignored the income and welfare implications of employment. A more comprehensive assessment of full employment and its economic effects cannot, on the other hand, avoid the question of whether increases in employment are the result of conscious policies or a by-product of inefficient planning. D. Granick has argued in favour of the first hypothesis, while P.

Evidence on India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act does not suggest that the potential for either providing work when needed or reducing current poverty is being realized, despite pro-poor targeting. Instead, work is often rationed by local leaders in poor areas, and the poverty impact is small when all the costs are considered. Decentralized implementation of the right-to-work poses serious challenges in poor places. The option of income support using cash transfers also has both pros and cons. Widely-used methods for finely targeting cash transfers tend to miss many poor people, and discourage those reached from earning extra income. Yet it cannot be presumed that switching to a universal basic income will reduce poverty more than workfare or finely-targeted transfers; that is an empirical question and the answer will undoubtedly vary across settings, belying the generalizations often heard from advocates. Nonetheless, more incentive-neutral, universal and/or state-contingent transfer schemes merit consideration in settings in which existing public spending is skewed against poor people and/or there is scope for raising taxes on the rich.",,Guaranteed Employment or Guaranteed Income,https://openalex.org/W3122823523

-15.410943,-34.830738,0,"Marital dissolutions occur for a variety of reasons. Among low income families, the added stress of inadequate earnings, intermittent job spells, and high unemployment may contribute to the decision to end a marriage. One approach to end poverty and marital instability is to give income assistance to the poor. At the same time, cash transfers might foster family breakups, intentionally or otherwise. For example, if the welfare system is designed such that individuals are better off living separately than together, there will be a financial incentive to split. The effect of income transfers on family structure is theoretically ambiguous. On the one hand, low income families may become more stable if stress factors associated with low earnings, intermittent job spells and the like are lessened by the receipt of assistance. On the other hand, unstable marriages held together strictly for economic convenience may have their bonds weakened if individuals, when separated, are eligible for support. Consequently, whether income assistance engenders, on balance, effects which are stabilising or destabilising is an empirical question which depends upon the specific population group and the assistance program under consideration. This paper employs microdata from MINCOME (Canada’s experimental test of guaranteed income) to examine the effect of various income transfers on family dissolution. Employing a path model, we find that family income level is principally an intervening rather than a direct factor in determining whether or not a family will stay intact. Our results suggest that whether or not the male head has a stable work pattern, and whether or not the female head works at all, or earns more than her spouse, are more direct contributors to marital instability than the level of family income itself.",https://doi.org/10.3138/jcfs.23.2.249,"Income, Work and Marital Dissolution: Canadian Experimental Evidence",https://openalex.org/W2287844010

In this paper, the narratives that accompanied the creation and cancellation of Ontario’s basic income pilot— respectively referred to as the ‘creation’ and ‘cancellation narratives’—are unpacked. The creation narrative states that basic income projects will reduce poverty, while the cancellation narrative states that basic income projects unjustly redistribute wealth through raising taxes. These narratives are also present in other basic income pilots; two of these are also analyzed in this paper, namely Finland and Manitoba’s basic income pilots. The paper concludes with a recommendation for policymakers who are advancing basic income projects in the future. Policymakers should advance a metanarrative that bridges the creation and cancellation narratives. This metanarrative would frame basic income projects as reducing poverty without unjustly redistributing wealth.

We calibrate the model to Brazilian data and introduce a UBI transfer equivalent to roughly 4.5% of average household income. We find that, over the short run, this policy alleviates poverty and increases welfare, especially for the poor. Over time, however, income falls and poverty and inequality increase as fewer people stay in school, labor supply decreases, and savings fall. We then explore the consequences of an equivalent transfer that is both subject to means testing and requires recipients to enroll their children in school. This policy outperforms the UBI in several dimensions, increasing overall income, reducing poverty and inequality, and improving welfare. This result is robust to varying the magnitude of the cash transfer.

We find that there are only few countries where the activation discourse has remained a dead letter. Most countries implement policy measures that aim to discourage benefit dependency among MIP recipients.

Inequalities in the distribution of incomes both reflect and reproduce inequalities of opportunity. Yet curiously little research has been conducted on what South Africans think about inequality, and their views on distributive justice. The limited extant research suggests that most South Africans believe that their country is too unequal, that there is strong support for government action to reduce inequalities, and that class consciousness and racial identities are both widespread. This paper uses existing and new data to show that distributive justice perceptions and attitudes in South Africa are mutable: perceptions and attitudes change according to the precise question posed, have changed over time, and change in the face of counter-arguments. South Africans, like people in many other parts of the world, see some poor people as more deserving than others, with perceived desert reflecting recognised needs (e.g. the elderly), responsibilities (e.g. bread-winners) and behaviour (with respondents being hostile to support for chronic drinkers, for example). Some, but not most, South Africans also become less supportive of the government supporting the poor if taxes are to be increased. Overall, South Africans seem to recognise a wide range of deserving poor, and even richer elites are inclined toward generosity, but support for redistribution is far from unconditional.",https://doi.org/10.1080/21528586.2007.10419165,The mutability of distributive justice attitudes in South Africa,https://openalex.org/W2055217466

In response to the threat of mass displacement of labor due to automation, economists, politicians, and even the business community have come to see Universal Basic Income (UBI) as the panacea. This paper argued against a UBI by addressing its implementation costs and inefficiency in mitigating the impact of automation through quantitative evidence as well as results of failed UBI-comparable programs across the world.

We highlight the importance of survey design and, by employing new survey data in each country, compare the levels and determinants of support for varied models of basic income. Our results point to the importance of the multi-dimensionality of basic income and the fragility of public support for the idea.

Rarely is workfare appraised in terms of how it affects other parties such as employers or other workers, and on the structural effects the pattern of incentives it generates brings about, or as an issue of distributive justice related to a more extensive range of objects of distribution such as access to pleasing jobs. We propose to evaluate workfare by looking at its effects more broadly: (1) we discuss and dismiss on empirical grounds the two most common arguments in favour of workfare, namely that workfare develops self‐reliance among participants and it is more economical in the use of altruism among taxpayers. (2) We suggest that workfare focuses on work as a burden and as a means to income, ignoring other beneficial aspects that are conducive to the worker’s self expression.

We use Scotland, a country where the First Minister has indicated her support for the principle behind the idea, to illustrate the application of our analytical approach. The implementation of such a UBI at scale represents a major societal shift that involves substantial rises in taxation as well as in payments. Much of the existing empirical evidence relates to schemes that are small and in which the beneficiaries bear none of the costs, so its applicability here is questionable. Our approach combines microsimulation, to identify the immediate impact of the UBI on the tax/benefit system and distribution of income, with macroeconomic modelling to identify and analyse the wider economic impact of potential behavioural responses. The macroeconomic impact of the UBI depends critically on workers’ and potential migrants’ behavioural responses to the increase in taxation as well as to increased benefits. However, it seems clear that any positive stimulus to productivity as a consequence, for example, of reduced precarity and increased training would need to be substantial to offset any adverse impact on the scale of economic activity, unless policymakers succeed in securing a social contract that dampens or eliminates workers’ pressure for higher wages in response to a reduction in take home pay.",,The Macroeconomic Impacts of a Universal Basic Income : An Application to Scotland,https://openalex.org/W3083478463

In Putting Human Universal Rights to Work, Archibald Stuart, an emeritus professor of social work, intends to lay out a logical policy strategy for increasing social justice. He notes, Social justice can be a vague and abstract objective unless concepts and steps for action are defined in detail (p. 3). Stuart focuses primarily on class struggle, relegating cultural or social issues to a second tier. He shows how privatization, capitalism, and   free-market often exploit workers and prevent people from escaping poverty. He delineates traditional arguments about equality of opportunity and equality of outcome, explaining how   former is touted as   pinnacle of social justice yet in fact further alienates workers from each other. In a shrinking or stagnant economy, finding a job is a zero-sum game, so simply offering more education does little to alleviate unemployment without concurrent restructuring of   labor market. His solution rests, in large part, on   provision of social security services and government regulation. He also suggests how   economy could be improved by different fiscal policies. For example, Stuart describes how tax credits might give consumers more spending money and thereby grow   economy. Such an effort to increase   well being of a population in a state-level society would be very useful, but   book's weaknesses leave it short of this lofty goal. Repeatedly, Stuart claims he will suggest means of building support for policy actions, yet he conflates all conservatives under   rubric of a laissez-faire conservatism [which] expresses   theme that   uncontrolled private market should dominate   social and economic process and   best government is one that governs   least (p. 11). Meanwhile, he characterizes his own social liberalism as concerned with   social order and social conditions. It is based on   belief in   dignity and worth of each individual... (p. 15) as if his adversaries did not share those same beliefs. His portrayal of one side as corrupt, uncaring capitalists and   other as moral and just does not create a space for working together and fosters   very antagonism he critiques. Stuart reduces complex socio-cultural motivations to economic interests; for example, he explains,   economic decline [of   mid-1970s] threatened low-income whites who were afraid of being displaced by African Americans who sought higher education as a means of competing for scarce, good jobs. The result was a backlash against   Civil Rights Movement that led may whites to shift to   conservative Republican party (p. 8). He also links advances in civil rights to   robust economy of   post-World War II era while linking increases in social security programs to times of economic hardship. He relates   shrinkage of social services in this current time period to the growing power of conservative forces,   decline in   number of persons employed in manufacturing, and a dramatic decline in union memberships (p. ix), leaving   reader to wonder whether   introduction of social security in   Roosevelt administration was   result of a perfect storm. …",,Putting Universal Human Rights to Work: Policy Actions in the Struggle for Social Justice by Archibald Stuart,https://openalex.org/W26794604

By this little formula (of Marxian origin, by the way), I refer to the ensemble of mentalities, images of the world and of oneself, behaviors and beliefs which, while false (that is, semblances) nonetheless originate in and derive a certain legitimacy from certain quite real and persistent aspects of today's mode of production. It's not a question, in other words, of subjective errors produced by the dominant culture, but of representations forcefully suggested by a very concrete condition. What is needed is an identification of the grain of truth that sustains false semblance. Such an investigation aims at a materialist recognition of subjectivity as it exists within post-Fordist capitalism. It would certainly be more comforting to assume that the illusions current today are the product of media propaganda and that they can therefore be refuted by means of a patient pedagogical project of clarification. Unfortunately this is not the case. There is a material basis for ideology, an objective foundation that reinforces and reproduces deception. To give a classic example: in the work of Marx, a considerable part of capitalist ideology is traced back to that rather concrete institution that [End Page 42] is … the wage. By being paid after labor has been made available, the wage in fact powerfully imposes the false belief that what is being remunerated is the work performed, when in fact what the capitalist purchases on the market is, for Marx, rather labor-power, the worker's pure psychosomatic capacity to produce. It is worth asking, then, what corresponds to the wage as an ""ideological fact"" in the era of post-Fordism: what are the contemporary foundations of socially necessary semblance? We will discuss three of many possible examples. 1. Self-employment It's not difficult to identify the material conditions that substantiate the illusory conviction of a considerable number of subordinated workers that they are able to and/or have to behave as ""their own employers."" Here, I want to insist on only one aspect of this phenomenon: so-called self-employment has its concrete basis in what precedes productive activity properly speaking—that is, in the vicissitudes one has to confront before performing this or that job (or in the interval between one job and another). No workers believe themselves to be managing their own lives because of the way they work, but rather because of the way they come to terms with the labor market. The time devoted to finding long-term employment (often quite a protracted period, riddled with brief and diverse jobs that are off the books, seasonal etc.) is at the heart of the ""self-employment"" experienced by post-Fordist workers. This protracted ""search"" is no longer an empty and passive intermediate period, but a genuine activity that requires initiative, open-mindedness, calculation, a sense of compatibility, and even some rudimentary analysis of ""market tendencies."" The person in search of employment ends up looking somewhat like a small stock broker, or a manager with public relations skills. Without the traditional mechanisms of job placement, it has become necessary to establish informal relations with the most diverse interlocutors. These relations, often rich with sticky psychological subtleties, require a certain amount of opportunism. And as Williamson teaches us, opportunism is the entrepreneurial skill par excellence.1 The concern with ""keeping in touch,"" with ""being around"" (that is, eternally available), with ""seizing the unexpected opportunity"" is a general feature of a form of socialization that takes place before and between jobs. Here, an important hypothesis suggests itself: the diversification and fragmentation of forms of employment occurs against the backdrop of a substantially unitary socialization process. It is this [End Page 43] socialization process that the project of political organization needs to grasp, whatever form that project may take. A critique of the illusions related to ""self-employment"" is possible only if it involves a recognition (and a political evaluation) of the enterpreneurial skills required for surviving on the labor market, the habit of not having any habits, the capacity to metabolize innovation. 2.

This result stemmed from a variety of factors: Social testing actually tends to exert a conservative influence on policymaking; and the time required to complete experiments and interpret results is often incompatible with the needs of policy makers. In addition, test results are often not effectively communicated to Congress, the administration and the public, and even when the results are conveyed, policy makers are frequently skeptical about the soundness of the methodologies employed.

-13.20997,-2.132272,5,"In the late 1980s, the sustainable development paradigm emerged to provide a framework through which economic growth, social welfare and environmental protection could be harmonized. However, more than 30 years later, we can assert that such harmonization has proved elusive. Steffen et al. (2015) have shown that four out of nine planetary boundaries have been crossed: climate change, impacts in biosphere integrity, land-system change and altered biochemical flows are a manifestation that human activities are driving the Earth into a new state of imbalance. Meanwhile, wealth concentration and inequality have increased, particularly during the last 50 years (Piketty 2014). In 2008, the collapse of large financial institutions was prevented by the public bailout of private banks and, nowadays, low growth rates are likely to become the norm in the economic development of mature economies (Summers 2013; IMF 2015; Teulings and Baldwin 2015). The three pillars of sustainability (environment, society and economy) are thus simultaneously threatened by an intertwined crisis. In an attempt to problematize the sustainable development paradigm, and its recent reincarnation in the concept of a ‘‘green economy’’, degrowth emerged as a paradigm that emphasizes that there is a contradiction between sustainability and economic growth (Kothari et al. 2015; Dale et al. 2015). It argues that the pathway towards a sustainable future is to be found in a democratic and redistributive downscaling of the biophysical size of the global economy (Schneider et al. 2010; D’Alisa et al. 2014). In the context of this desired transformation, it becomes imperative to explore ways in which sustainability science can explicitly and effectively address one of the root causes of social and environmental degradation worldwide, namely, the ideology and practice of economic growth. This special feature aims to do so by stressing the deeply contested and political nature of the debates around the prospects, pathways and challenges of a global transformation towards sustainability. The ‘growth’ paradigm (Dale 2012; Purdey 2010) is indeed largely accepted in advanced and developing countries alike as an unquestioned imperative and naturalized need. It escapes ‘the political’, i.e. the contested public terrain where different imaginaries of possible socio-ecological orders compete over the symbolic and material institutionalization of these visions. In this sense, the contemporary context of neoliberal capitalism appears as a post-political space, i.e. a political formation that forecloses the political, the legitimacy of dissenting voices and positions (Swyngedouw 2007). As Swyngedouw (2014:91) argues: ‘‘the public management of things and people is hegemonically articulated around a naturalization of the need of economic growth and capitalism as the only reasonable and possible form of organization of socionatural metabolism.

27.663296,-33.775383,0,"I INTRODUCTION Since 1975, the earned income tax credit (EITC)   transformed from   small, obscure provision of the federal tax code into one of the largest programs in the U.S. social-welfare system. Today, the EITC stands as the largest cash-transfer program for low-income workers with children, providing $47 billion in benefits each year to 24 million families.' Politicians, advocates, and scholars have praised the EITC. President Bill Clinton famously called the EITC a cornerstone of our effort to reform the welfare system and   work pay. (2) Steve Holt of the Brookings Institution (among others) argues that the EITC has proved remarkably successful in reducing poverty ..., [lifting] more children out of poverty than any other social program or category of programs. And, as often noted, support for the EITC spans the political spectrum. (4) Among its other attributes, the EITC is   political winner, as well: Congress   legislated major increases in funding while spending on other cash transfers   remained flat. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the growth of the EITC as   percentage of GDP since 1975, alongside declines in federal spending on unemployment insurance and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] (5) [FIGURE 2 OMITTED] (6) The political history of the EITC--the story of how the credit came to occupy its current position in the U.S. social-welfare state--has been ably told by others. (7) In this article, I offer an evaluation of the significance of the credit and, in   historical spirit, hark back to an earlier, critical perspective on the EITC--a perspective rarely heard in recent years. The EITC arose from the ashes of the negative income tax in the mid-1970s. (8) From its earliest days, the EITC prospered politically because it appeared to promote and reward paid work--helping answer the charge that   negative income tax would support the idle. Still, remaining supporters of the negative income tax sounded   cautionary note: they worried that the EITC did too little to address poverty, unemployment, and eroding wages. (9) Here, I argue that these concerns remain apt, despite the expansion of the EITC and oft-repeated praise for its importance as an antipoverty program. My thesis is that the EITC--in anything like its present form--does not, and cannot, make work pay, because it operates in   legal context that creates deep disadvantage for low-wage workers and their children. Like any good political slogan, making work   is ambiguous: it   multiple meanings that appeal to different constituencies. (10) Here, I interpret the phrase in its distributive sense; I assume that the goal is to     meaningful improvement in the wellbeing of low-income families and workers. Still, the phrase defies precise definition: making work   might connote only an effort to improve incentives, that is, to induce individuals to work, whether or not their wellbeing improves by much. The same normative ambiguity pervaded the last decade's welfare reforms in the United States: some believed that work could improve the wellbeing of low-income families, while others supported work as   moral matter or as   means of reducing the welfare rolls. Obviously, if one takes the view that formal employment is the primary goal of the EITC program, and family wellbeing is irrelevant, the analysis here will be of no interest. Similarly, if one understands the EITC as aiming at nothing more than   reduction in the marginal and average tax rates facing low-income families, then its failure to   work pay (in the distributive sense) will not be troubling. The analysis here highlights three features of U.S. law that constrain the effectiveness of the EITC in improving the wellbeing of low-income workers and their children: labor and employment laws that structure markets that produce low wages and harsh working conditions, laws that condition access to primary goods on market earnings, and   social safety net with gaps through which low-income workers often fall. …",,Why the EITC Doesn't Make Work Pay,https://openalex.org/W3125318092

Pilot studies of a UBI are underway or in the works on three continents. And prominent voices from across the ideological spectrum have expressed support for a UBI or one of its variants, including libertarian Charles Murray, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, labor leader Andy Stern, and — most recently — former President Barack Obama. Although even the most optimistic advocates for a UBI will acknowledge that nationwide implementation lies years away, the design of a basic income will require sustained scholarly attention. This article seeks to advance the conversation among academics and policymakers about UBI implementation. 

Our prior work has focused on the philosophical foundations of a basic income; here, we build up from those foundations to identify the practical building blocks of a large-scale cash transfer program. After canvassing the considerations relevant to the design of a UBI, we arrive at a set of specific recommendations for policymakers. We propose a UBI of $6000 per person per year, paid to all citizens and lawful permanent residents via direct deposit in biweekly installments. We argue — contrary to other UBI proponents — that children and seniors should be included, that adjustments for household size and cost of living should be rejected, that recipients should have a limited ability to use future payments as collateral for short- and medium-term loans, and that the Social Security Administration should carry out the program. We also explain how a UBI could be financed through the consolidation of existing cash and near-cash transfer programs as well as the imposition of a relatively modest surtax on all earners.

Importantly, the building blocks of a UBI do not necessarily determine its outward face. By this, we mean that economically identical programs can be described in very different ways — e.g., as a UBI with no phaseout, a UBI that phases out with income, and a “negative income tax” — without altering any of the essential features. To be sure, packaging matters to the public perception of a UBI, and we consider reasons why some characterizations of the program may prove more popular than others. Our article seeks to sort the building blocks of a UBI out from the cosmetic components, thereby clarifying which elements of a UBI shape implementation and which ones affect only the outward appearance.",,The Architecture of a Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W3122404096

At the constitutional stage we determine which welfare scheme society agrees to implement behind the veil of ignorance and with a Rawlsian objective. Since social health insurance not only redistributes income from rich to poor but also from low-risk to high-risk agents, the doubly disadvantaged in society – low-income and high-risk agents – may lose out in the political process when a basic income scheme is in place. Depending on the amount of health care expenditure and the inequalities in income and risk, it may well be that a society will find it optimal to set up an institutional framework for a social health insurance scheme only.",,The Political Sustainability of a Basic Income Scheme and Social Health Insurance,https://openalex.org/W1759583669

There is some concern about disincentive effects, particularly when people draw benefits from more than one program. This article describes the theory and operation of recent income supplement programs in Britain, the problems and anomalies of each, and the government's attempts to devise solutions. The British and American experiences are compared in the concluding section. The British interest in a reverse income tax, in common with the American interest, has been inspired by many motives. It does not appear, however, to have involved any primary concern for altering work behavior among present recipients of supplementary benefits (public assistance) by using income-conditioning of benefits as an incentive strategy. Rather, the hope has been that tax burdens and total government expenditures could be restrained through increased reliance upon selective policies. Those who could afford to pay more for the use of social services should accept higher user charges, while the poor should receive benefits based on a test of income. The underlying rationale has been that scarce resources should be concentrated upon those in greatest need. This strategy has therefore called for the gradual reduction of universal and general subsidies.

Like its predecessors, the Conservative government hoped to improve the value of cash benefits while increasing charges for services. As a result, the cost of school meals, which had been subsidized as part of a broader food subsidy, was increased. Similarly, in a major reform of housing finances, the Conservative government will increase rents in public Council housing to a level which approaches their market value. Charges in National Health Service programs for prescriptions, dental, and optical costs have also been increased. These increased costs strain the budgets of lower-income families. Therefore, special means-tested benefits, in the form of free school meals, rent rebates, or National Health Service exemptions, had to be extended to larger numbers of families to relieve the hardships that accompany the price increases in school meals, rent, and medical care. In addition to reducing general subsidies and relying upon different means tests for in-kind and earmarked programs, the government has sought a general cash supplement to aid the working poor, a group that public policy had neglected-but not altogether. One way to aid the working poor was by family allowances. A way of limiting the cost of increasing them within the framework of a universal scheme had been introduced by the Labor government. The scheme integrated any additional increases in direct expenditures for family allowances with a reduction in the value of tax exemptions for children. This system was known as claw-back. FROM CLAW-BACK TO FIS It may be useful to review briefly the operation of claw-back, because the means-tested Family Income Supplements (FIS) bill, which altogether abandoned a universal approach, emerged as a result of its limitations. Claw-back was introduced in 1968 as a way to concentrate additional benefits in family allowances selectively among the poor. It operated so that the standard-rate taxpayer, that is, a family paying 32 percent of its marginal taxable income on income tax, received virtually no benefit from these increases. At that time this included most of the British taxpaying public. This objective was accomplished by offsetting the proposed increase in family allowances with an equivalent reduction in the total personal tax allowance. In this way, the increase benefited in full those who were below the tax threshold and also benefited, at least in part, those reduced-rate taxpayers who were paying taxes below the 32 percent level. The 1968 increase of ?183 million in gross expenditures concentrated ?47 million on low income families paying below the standard rate. And much of the rest was recouped through taxation, since family allowances were subject to income tax.

The debates and discussions in which Paine wants to intervene cannot be the same in Wilkes's England as in revolutionary France. Locating the proposal of a universal basic income in this context has important implications for the history of its conception.

This paper tries to explore the arguments regarding how the UBI could be instrumental in realizing the major objectives of theories of justice.

In particular, the emphasis on distributing the tax burden relative to pretax income is a fundamental mistake. Taxation does not take from people what they already own. Property rights are the product of a set of laws and conventions, of which the tax system forms a central part, so the fairness of taxes can’t be evaluated by their impact on preexisting entitlements. Pretax income has no independent moral significance. Standards of justice should be applied not to the distribution of tax burdens but to the operation and results of the entire framework of economic institutions.

Microsimulation models have played a central role in the formulation, the assessment, and the reformulation of these proposals. They have been used to assess the effects of proposals on the distribution of income and on labour supply incentives, and to examine their revenue effects. To the best of our knowledge, microsimulation analysis has not been used to examine the effects of the same basic income in the two countries. Such analysis has a number of attractions. From a substantive policy point of view, it is of interest in the context of proposals for harmonisation of social protection across EU member states; and can help to shed light on the nature of the differences between the current systems, by comparing them against a common benchmark.

Under a linear income tax system, we show that (i) the NIT can replicate the allocation of the UBI exactly by providing an identical marginal effective tax schedule, and (ii) the budget of the NIT is always smaller than that of the UBI. According to our quantitative model, which is calibrated to approximate the income and wealth distributions in the United States, the optimal UBI is to pay everyone 7.2% of the average income.

Obtaining a sufficient citizenship-based income without work obligations is fundamentally opposing the foundations of the welfare systems that are in place nowadays. As BI has gained increasing attention in public debates and among policymakers, questions arise about its social legitimacy. This study is the first to analyse a broad range of explanatory individual and contextual factors that may affect popular support for BI. In addition, we study how BI support is related to support of current welfare provisions, to analyse how radically different people perceive a BI to be. We use a unique survey question – available for 23 European countries, from the recent release of the European Social Survey (2016) –that introduces BI with an extended definition, emphasizing its universal and unconditional character and that it will replace other benefits and services and is paid for by taxes. Results show relatively high, but varying levels of support among European countries and social groups. People who are in a more vulnerable socio-economic position support BI more, as well as political left-wingers, egalitarianists and people who support targeting benefits at the poor. Also, a BI is more supported in countries with higher levels of material deprivation. This pattern of relations on both the individual and contextual levels seems to suggest that it is not the universal character or its unconditionality that makes a BI so attractive to a large share of the European population, but the fact that it provides (poor) people with a guaranteed minimum income. We also find that people who support other welfare reforms are more supportive of a BI.

As with other policy areas, the effects of enhanced Treasury micro-management of the Government's reform agenda has begun to impact upon the field of planning. The prime example in this respect is the Treasury's preference for replacing state provision of welfare-enhancing services with the move towards an individualized system of asset-based welfare. The article begins with an analysis of this shift, showing how it is dependent on creating financialized economic agents who think instinctively as active saver-investors in their quest to accumulate assets to fund future consumption of welfare. In contemporary Britain the housing market dominates the accumulation of assets amongst everyday saver-investors. The article concludes by analysing the possible tension that will be introduced into the planning process because of New Labour's twin goals: (1) to defend the current value of asset wealth even as the mortgage lending market has stalled and confidence in the stability of house prices has temporarily evaporated; and (2) to restrict exclusion from private ownership in the housing market so that broadening access can be used to propel a universal move towards an individualized system of asset-based welfare.

It is shown that due to the unclear consequences of the impact of the introduction of UBI payments on various aspects of the life of modern societies, due to the impossibility of making payments in full compliance with the basic principles of UBI, such as universality and unconditionality due to political, economic and other restrictions, imitation is widely used in the world to evaluate its possible effects. A review of approaches to simulation modeling in the EU countries, international research, and financial organizations (OECD, World Bank, International Monetary Fund) and the Russian experience in modeling the effects of the introduction of transitional forms of UBI is carried out. The formulation of the task of introducing the UBI to overcome absolute monetary poverty has been carried out. It is shown that to solve this problem, it is expedient to consider the UBI as a guaranteed minimum per capita income of a poor household, equal to the regional subsistence minimum or the conditional basic income for overcoming poverty. To increase the actual incomes of low-income households up to the regional subsistence minimum, it is proposed to pay them, after providing standard targeted social support, the additional differentiated regional social payment (poverty benefit). Algorithms for determining this payment have been developed. The substantiation of the possibility and feasibility of modeling the effects of poverty benefit according to the domestic model of the tempo-deflator type has been carried out. The results of predictive calculations for this model are presented. It is shown that the additional revenues of the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation not only compensate for the initial costs of implementing the conditional UBI program but also annually exceed the initial costs by about 1,35 times. The country's leadership was proposed to combine the current system of targeted social support for the poor with payments of the conditional UBI to more consistently solve the problem of absolute monetary poverty",https://doi.org/10.19181/lsprr.2021.17.2.4,Simulation of scenarios for overcoming absolute monetary poverty in Russia based on the concept of unconditional basic income,https://openalex.org/W3169640568

The Failed Welfare Revolution shows us that things might have turned out differently. During the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers in three presidential administrations tried to replace the nation's existing welfare system with a revolutionary program to guarantee Americans basic economic security. Surprisingly from today's vantage point, guaranteed income plans received broad bipartisan support in the 1960s. One proposal, President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan, nearly passed into law in the 1970s, and President Carter advanced a similar bill a few years later. The failure of these proposals marked the federal government's last direct effort to alleviate poverty among the least advantaged and, ironically, sowed the seeds of conservative welfare reform strategies under President Reagan and beyond. This episode has largely vanished from America's collective memory. Here, Brian Steensland tells the whole story for the first time--from why such an unlikely policy idea first developed to the factors that sealed its fate. His account, based on extensive original research in presidential archives, draws on mainstream social science perspectives that emphasize the influence of powerful stakeholder groups and policymaking institutions. But Steensland also shows that some of the most potent obstacles to guaranteed income plans were cultural. Most centrally, by challenging Americans' longstanding distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor, the plans threatened the nation’s cultural, political, and economic status quo.",,Introduction to The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy,https://openalex.org/W3123601428

-30.894392,28.110256,5,"This manifesto takes a broad and critical approach to entrepreneurial research. The author consciously uses a provocative way of arguing for the importance of challenging received academic wisdom about entrepreneurship.It is a manifesto that spells out why we should question the idea that entrepreneurship research is neutral. It is the academic's privilege to ask questions; hence the appeal here to critical theory, familiar from other traditions than business management, and a useful corrective when considering the dominant and hegemonic perspectives in entrepreneurship research.The manifesto presents entrepreneurship as something that goes far beyond market-oriented business to an enterprising spirit that could keep society self-reflecting and self-critical by questioning what it takes for granted; mobilizing the entrepreneurial energies of those who voluntarily marginalize themselves–individuals and groups who are not afraid to stand out, channeling their self-confidence to defend values that contrast the dominant ones. They are to be found among performance artists practising social art, extreme entrepreneurs, and creative anarchists who take society itself as their target when trying to instigate change.When the entrepreneurial focus is not the market per se, but rather the social norms and values in which economic activity is embedded, the entrepreneur's task becomes to challenge whatever is taken for granted–an incitement that is as much social as economic. Thus, the entrepreneur as a provocateur takes on the most established institutions, her only guiding principle being to question whatever principles that society unthinkingly espouses, whatever is taken for granted. Unlike market entrepreneurs, who appreciate institutions since they provide an otherwise unknowable environment with basic rules of the game, provocative entrepreneurs question even the most formal, long-standing institutions. Their motivation is a generic obstinacy, and their vision is to be recognized for making people aware–and for their actions, even as they rub saltpetre in society's wounds.Entrepreneurship in the form it is presented in this manifesto asks the awkward question or presents the uncomfortable truth, forcing all to take a long hard look at themselves in a cold, self-critical light. The essays here cover a variety of forms of anarchist entrepreneurship–all with a strong driving spirit. The manifesto aims to stimulate entrepreneurs and researchers, as well as politicians and citizens, to engage, to initiate, and to act, all in the name of the society.",,Basic Income Beyond Wage Slavery : In Search of Transcending Political Aesthetics,https://openalex.org/W1598634798

11.673047,8.536999,5,"Unconditional basic income is not a new topic in political economy, and it gains new momentum as more and more research is being devoted to it. The discussion focuses on the adequacy and effects such a policy measure may entail for a person and his socio-economic situation, usually. Object of investigation is the individual, and the corresponding theory is of micro-economic descent. In this paper, in contrast, we develop a method of how to assess feasibility and consequences of an unconditional basic income for a modern, open economy, on the macroeconomic level, using concepts and statistics of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) as our main tool. A SAM-based approach can measure, and perhaps model, the impact on the economic activity of a country, and on its economic institutions of new policy measures such as introducing an unconditional basic income. 

The economic activity of a country is expressed in monetary flows as registered in the National Accounts. So their underlying principles and definitions are adopted. However, the habitual way of putting an economy into a sequence of institutional accounts connecting each institution’s income to the cost, - similar to business accounting - reveals only one, namely the inner-institutional half of the economic circuit. The other, outer half, namely, how the costs of one institution generate income for another one is better captured by the format of a Social Accounting Matrix. In the paper, the impact of an unconditional basic income is quantified, for macroeconomic aggregates of institutional sectors and socio-economic groups of households, taking the German and the Portuguese economies as examples. Purpose of the paper is not to argue for, or against, an unconditional basic income, but to offer a scientific tool with which to calculate and assess possibilities and consequences of the proposal, for a national economy as a whole.",,Unconditional Basic Income: Who Gets It?

Section I summarizes a formal model of labor supply which indicates that the response of a rational individual to a temporary negative income tax would differ from his response to a   program, and that a limited duration experiment will correspondingly yield a biased prediction of permanent behavior.' Qualitative statements are made about the nature of the biases and their relationship to interest or discount rates, time horizons, and concepts of intertemporal substitution. Section II discusses strategies for empirical estimation of the predicted effects of a   negative income tax from what is, in principle, observable from an ideally constructed experiment; alternative strategies to handle data limitations implicit in the experiment are then proposed.

This idea has generated wide interest in a number of countries, and is being actively discussed by several political parties. This book explains how these changes would benefit a wide variety of social groups, leading to a greater redistribution of income. At the same time, it also raises the question of whether a single reform can meet the very different objectives of different supporters. The author reviews different areas of public economics in which there has been active research in recent years-- namely the theory of optimum taxation, public choice theory, general equilibrium analysis of incidence, numerical tax- benefit modelling, and econometric studies of work incentives--and asks how these contribute to our understanding of this particular policy reform.

Methods: Applying modified versions of the principles of UD to disability social policy and using core interpretative strategies for human rights implementation (used in the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) to illuminate, by analogy, ways to resolve the dilemma between seeking equality and respecting difference. Results: The aspirations of UD in architecture and planning – namely to design buildings and cities to accommodate the needs of the widest spectrum of abilities as possible – can successfully be applied to social policy that focuses on the needs and circumstances of persons with disabilities, and which underwrites a blueprint for reform in the delivery of social services. Conclusions: “Universal social policy”, and UD, are feasible and desirable approaches to their respective domains, if we adopt a strategy derived from the legal interpretation of human rights implementation.

The paper then examines what has been learned to date from the experience with CCTs in the South and raises a series of questions concerning the relevance and replicability of these lessons in other contexts. The paper concludes with a call for further knowledge sharing in two areas: between the North and South as the experience with welfare reform and CCTs in particular expands, and between behavioral science and welfare policy.",https://doi.org/10.1596/27343,North-South Knowledge Sharing on Incentive-based Conditional Cash Transfer Programs,https://openalex.org/W2165079568

Studies of Turkey’s welfare regime exhibit a significant degree of variation in terms of both approaches and conclusions, resulting in little in the way of consensus. Among Turkish-language studies (and some, but not all, Turkish scholars writing in English), there does seem to be a broad consensus that Turkey may be classified as part of the Southern European welfare model, which squares with the modal conclusion of the English-language studies on the topic.

These countries are the major world producers and represent 3 continents, different systems and structures of production, different models of social and labor relations, and different government systems. Key information was obtained by applying a structured questionnaire in situ, between March and May 2008. The results indicated significant differences among those 3 countries. In Brazil, the rural social security, minimum wage and access to basic education stand out in the process of achieving citizenship, in spite of possible criticism. Moreover, in Brazil, there are indications that in the short and medium runs, the guarantee of basic income can generate accommodation and lack of interest among growers in higher technological levels and independence of the family from governmental support. In Vietnam, in addition to access to school, the peaceful access to land through legislation sticks out, which can be seen as a key to citizenship in a society of mainly rural traits. In Uganda, the absence of mechanisms to guarantee the basic income makes access to citizenship dependent on changes in productivity and international coffee prices, the main source of income of the country. The advancement of citizenship observed in Brazil and Vietnam was not achieved in most African countries, whose characteristics are very similar to those observed in Uganda. However, although access to education, housing, gender equality, health, leisure and culture are much more advanced in Brazil, this is no longer decisive for the country, since coffee does not have the same civilizing potential that it had in the past century.

The original sceptics of ‘welfarism’ were doubtful that increased state activity could combine efficiency and freedom in the delivery of welfare services and the more honest of the original advocates of interventionism were prepared to accept a loss of individual liberty on grounds of expediency.

As such, it is held up as a model and inspiration for the implementation of basic income schemes in other US states and other countries. In this chapter, I question the characterization of the PFD as either a basic income or a robust model for one. I argue instead that the PFD is a resource dividend, a form of redistribution that is related to, but not synonymous with, a basic income. While the ideas of basic income and resource dividends share some philosophical justifications and some roots in intellectual history, they are different enough that they ought not to be confused. Beyond a philosophical desire for semantic clarity, the distinction matters because the justifications for different forms of redistribution, both those justifications that are part of the popular understanding and those that have a more limited academic currency, affect their chances for implementation, their sustainability, and their vulnerability to political processes. In particular, it is possible to design resource dividends in ways that are incompatible with the goals of a basic income and that lead to outcomes in tension with, if not opposed to, its goals.

Poverty, income inequality and unemployment are expected to rise all around the world due to the pandemic corona virus outbreak and the subsequent economic crisis. Governments around the world have already implemented measures similar to universal basic income with the purpose of increasing household consumption and stimulating aggregate demand but also to mitigate the devastating effects that the recent unfavorable economic developments have on the citizens living in poverty or are at the risk of poverty. However, shrinking fiscal spaces of small economies could be an obstacle to implement such policies. Compared to universal basic income, negative income tax is a less costly policy option that targets the population living in poverty instead of providing payments to everyone regardless of their income. The analysis based on the available data is indicating that implementing such policy would cost as much as 9.7 billion MKD per year, which is 4% of the planned state budget revenues for Y2020, 8% of the planned social transfers for Y2020 and 29% of the funds that the state has made available for tackling the COVID 19 crisis so far. In addition, the negative income tax could trigger various positive effects on the economy. Since poor people spend almost all of their income, it could be expected that implementing negative income tax would rise household consumption.

This CBI proposal responds to two important empirical developments. The first concerns growing discussions around cash transfer programs (CTPs) and universal basic income (UBI). These are increasingly implemented or piloted yet do not usually take into account environmental issues including biodiversity conservation. The second relates to MBIs like payments for ecosystem services (PES) and REDD+ (reduced emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation). In practice, these programs have not only commonly failed to halt biodiversity loss and alleviate poverty but have also largely abandoned their market-based origins, leading to calls for moving beyond market-based conservation entirely.

33.058506,-37.478436,3,"<h3>Background</h3> Population mental health has deteriorated in many high-income countries over the last decade. Novel welfare policies such as Universal Basic Income (UBI) have been suggested as potential approaches to improve mental health. However, no studies have trialled or modelled UBI at a whole population level or considered impacts on mental health inequalities. We simulated the effects of introducing a UBI on mental health for UK working-age adults. <h3>Methods</h3> We used the SimPaths microsimulation model, which integrates econometric and causal epidemiology analyses to model effects of UK tax/benefit policies on mental health. Adults aged 25–64 were simulated from 2022–2026. Data from the nationally representative UK Household Longitudinal Study were used to generate the simulated population, and causal effect estimates of income/employment transitions on short-term mental health using marginal structural modelling. Three counterfactual UBI scenarios of increasing generosity were simulated from 2023: ‘Partial’ (equivalent to existing benefits), ‘Full’ (equivalent to the 2022 UK Minimum Income Standard), and ‘Full+’ (retained means-tested benefits for disability, housing, and childcare). The ‘Baseline’ scenario simulated planned tax/benefit policies for 2023–26. Likely common mental disorder (CMD) was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, score ≥ 4). Relative and slope indices of inequality (RII/SII) by education were calculated. Simulations were run 1,000 times to generate 95% uncertainty intervals. Sensitivity analyses relaxed assumptions about likely employment effects of UBI in Full/Full+ scenarios. <h3>Results</h3> Partial UBI slightly reduced poverty (before housing costs) but had no impact on mental health. Full UBI scenarios substantially reduced poverty, from 9.1% (8.5–9.7) to 0.01% (0.00–0.03), but decreased employment from 78.9% (77.9–79.9) to 74.1% (72.6–75.4). In our primary analysis, with Full+ UBI absolute CMD prevalence increased by 0.38% (0.13–0.69), a rise of 158,004 cases (54,054–286,902). In sensitivity analyses assuming minimal employment effects, CMD prevalence instead fell by 0.26% (-0.46, -0.05), a reduction of 108,108 cases (20,790–191,268). In both analyses, effects waned by 2026. Despite a small gradient in effect by education, there was no significant effect of any scenario on mental health inequalities: for Full+ UBI, RII reduced from 1.33 (1.13, 1.56) in the Baseline scenario by 0.03 points (-0.09, 0.02) in primary analysis and 0.02 (-0.06, 0.02) in sensitivity analysis. <h3>Conclusion</h3> UBI has potential to improve short-term population mental health, but impacts are highly contingent on individual choices around employment following its introduction. In our simulation, UBI had no clear impact on mental health inequalities.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2023-ssmabstracts.288,OP159 How would the introduction of a Universal Basic Income influence mental health inequalities in the UK?

Method: The eight flaws are grouped into four categories on how they affect impact estimates: statistical imprecision; biases; failure of impact estimates to measure effects of the planned treatment; and flaws that result from weakening an evaluation design. Each flaw is illustrated with examples from social experiments.

Results: Some of the flaws result in minor hurdles, while others cause evaluations to fail—that is, the evaluation is unable to provide a valid test of the hypothesis of interest. The flaws that appear to occur most frequently are response bias resulting from attrition, failure to adequately implement the treatment as designed, and too small a sample to detect impacts. The third of these can result from insufficient marketing, too small an initial target group, disinterest on the part of the target group in participating (if the treatment is voluntary), or attrition.

-47.48208,-20.486172,4,"1 Introduction Although Germany has a long-standing reputation as a passive welfare   with elaborate schemes of status-protecting income replacement through   insurance in case of unemployment and a full-blown system of active   market policies, all benefit systems had formal elements of activation and work requirement--but they had not been enforced systematically. In recent years, however, reforms of active and passive   market   were implemented in Germany in order to create a more activating   market and     regime and awake dormant activation principles. Changing the system of unemployment insurance benefits and basic income support as well as the repertoire of active   market   instruments and making benefit receipt more conditional upon job search and acceptance of job offers was a major issue on the political agenda. This led to a system shift away from Bismarckian status-protecting benefits towards a more Beveridgean model of income support with strong activation requirements. In the realm of unemployment benefits the dominant regime is no longer a   insurance benefit but a means-tested flat-rat transfer. The reform of the benefit system also involved a major overhaul of the governance of   market   and has far-reaching implications for the logic of the German welfare state. All these reforms generated considerable public attention and interest from foreign observers. This article provides an indepth account of the institutional change, its practical implementation and midterm outcomes and assesses if the desired economic and societal objectives of activation could be achieved through the adopted reforms. 2 The Shift towards Activation The Legacy of a Conservative European Welfare State The German welfare   is typically depicted as the prime example of the conservative welfare regime, for which the preservation of   status is central (Esping-Andersen 1990). It has also been prominently characterized as a frozen welfare state highly resistant to change (Manow and Seils 2000). Facing a difficult economic environment since the mid-seventies,   makers and   partners used active and passive   market policies to reduce   supply by taking surplus labor out of the   market and shifting the unemployed to benefit schemes and active programs that were not effectively oriented towards swift reintegration into the   market (Manow and Seils 2000). For some decades, active and passive   market policies provided a convenient and socially acceptable way of subsidizing entrepreneurial adjustment to dynamic global markets and help stabilize competitiveness of manufacturing that was at the core of the German employment system (Streeck 1997) while at the same time facilitating a social policy approach to unemployment emphasizing income protection and benevolent treatment through active policies. Availability of rather generous insurance-based   benefits related to   market status and skills in the tradition of a Bismarckian model helped limiting income inequality and wage dispersion. Rather than creating a flexible and more inclusive   market, the institutional arrangement of the German   market of the eighties and nineties was conducive to limiting low-wage employment and wage inequality. This model focusing skilled   was also stabilized by rather restrictive   market regulation (Estevez-Abe et al. 2001). Whereas this institutional pattern helped stabilize the core of the   market, it also resulted in a strong segmentation of the   market and   long-term unemployment. However, the German high equality, low activity equilibrium (Streeck 2001) resulted in an ever increasing burden of non-wage   costs as a growing number of benefit recipients in the   market directly translated into rising   security contributions and fiscal pressure on the   budget that was used to cover deficits in   insurance. …",,Activating Labor Market and Social Policies in Germany: From Status Protection to Basic Income Support,https://openalex.org/W242462595

Like other historical precedents of contemporary basic income movements, the WfH campaign was unsuccessful in achieving its policy goal. Despite its failure, its identification of unwaged housewives as workers, its extension of the concept of the housewife to precarious workers in the globalized economy, and its identification of the strategic deficiencies of mainstream working class and feminist movements are critical to contextualizing contemporary debates on basic income and to the development of successful strategies for contemporary working class movements.",https://doi.org/10.5209/poso.78022,Wages for Housework: The Marxist-Feminist Case for Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W4288433573

Moreover, atypical workers differ from the unemployed by not participating less in elections than insiders.

Contrary to popular impression, this claim has not yet been disproved by either history or economic theory. It is the failure of both the political right and the left to disentangle the concepts of private ownership and the competitive market that has led to the premature obituaries for socialism. In the second section, we look at the question of the “soft budget constraint” as an agency problem under market socialism. We then propose two variants of a bank-centric system of insider monitoring as a viable solution to the agency problem. The next section discusses the essential problem of political accountability and the difficulty of credible pre-commitment in avoiding the soft budget constraint problem, and suggests ways of minimizing this problem in our proposed system.

It is argued that the timing of ""option-luck"" failures  in particular, whether they occur early in a lifetime of calculated gambles, and whether they are clustered together  may lead to a form of ""brute bad luck,"" referred to as ""cumulative misfortune."" A basic income that is paid on a regular basis provides a way to prevent the emergence of cumulative misfortune, because the basic income at least partially replenishes the individual's ability to take the next calculated gamble. The upshot of this is a nonpaternalistic justification for an unconditional basic income that is paid regularly and is nonmortgageable. This has an important bearing on the debate between those who advocate a one-off endowment at the start of adult life and those who advocate a basic income paid regularly throughout one's life.

First, the majority of the poor now live in middle-income countries where the benefits of growth have often been distributed selectively and unequally. Second, a reservoir of extreme poverty remains in low-income countries where growth is erratic and aid often fails to reach the poor. If the international community is to most effectively leverage available resources to end extreme poverty, it must ensure that its investments in institutions and physical infrastructure actually provide the poor the capabilities they need to craft an effective pathway out of poverty. We term the human and social systems that are required to form this pathway “invisible infrastructure” and argue that an effective domestic state is central to building this. By corollary, ending extreme poverty will require both expanding state capacity and giving the poor power to demand reforms they need by solving agency problems between citizens, politicians, and bureaucrats.",https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.32.4.173,Ending Global Poverty: Why Money Isn’t Enough,https://openalex.org/W2899029446

The second is one of personal fulfillment and meaning: if people no longer have to work, what will they do with their lives? In this article, I set aside the first issue and focus on the second. In doing so, I make three arguments. First, I argue that there are good reasons to embrace non-work and that these reasons become more compelling in an era of technological unemployment. Second, I argue that the technological advances that make widespread technological unemployment possible could still threaten or undermine human flourishing and meaning, especially if (as is to be expected) they do not remain confined to the economic sphere. And third, I argue that this threat could be contained if we adopt an integrative approach to our relationship with technology. In advancing these arguments, I draw on three distinct literatures: (1) the literature on technological unemployment and workplace automation; (2) the antiwork critique-which I argue gives reasons to embrace technological unemployment; and (3) the philosophical debate about the conditions for meaning in life-which I argue gives reasons for concern.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-016-9770-5,Will Life Be Worth Living in a World Without Work?

Our considerations are located in the Marxist tradition and based mainly on contributions to the Marxist analytical framework made by Rosa Luxemburg and Michał Kalecki. We argue that basic income should lead to a rise of the share of wages in the GDP, by significantly improving workers’ bargaining position in various ways: through increasing the effective demand and investments by redistributing income to the advantage of the poorer groups of the society; through guaranteeing the realisation of basic needs outside the labour market; through positive influence on the collective bargaining power, especially during a strike; and through enhancing engagement in alternative relations of production as well as in political struggle for a better situation of working people.

Second, people make significant trade-offs between various policy design dimensions and the deservingness criteria associated with them.

Basic income proposals have always had strong defenders and critics among feminists. Some feminists have argued that basic income will finally deliver the long-awaited recognition of unpaid work and caregiving, work that is primarily performed by women. Other feminists have worried that a basic income would function as hush money, discouraging women from striving for more far-reaching gender equality. Both views are prima facie plausible. Both views have also been defended in the growing body of gender analyses published in the last decades. The first published views by basic income advocates stated that basic income was a good thing for women: unpaid work would be socially recognised, women’s autonomy would be strengthened, women’s bargaining position within the household would improve, and men would be encouraged to share more in the",https://doi.org/10.2202/1932-0183.1137,Introduction: Revisiting the Feminism and Basic Income Debate,https://openalex.org/W1983765585

One of its problems is that it was not created as a single whole. Instead of this, there are different kinds of social assistance service depending on the region, so there is a real need to reduce the complexity of these schemes and homogenise the benefits paid out in a general basic social benefit. In this paper we propose a new approach to universal basic protection benefit (called Basic Social Benefit) as a way of unifying and rationalising the different grants and economic aids currently available in Spain in order to cover the basic needs of all citizens. This is the first study made in Spain in calculating the lump sum of a basic social benefit for the whole population. For this, we use Quantile Regression (QR) to calculate the principal variables that explain the minimum vital expenditures of Spanish citizens.

The subjective experience of social exclusion is the response to a coping process that is mediated by family integration and social support.

Overall, a high proportion of the young state benefit recipients experience deprivation in several aspects of their living conditions but just a few of them feel socially excluded as well.

To do so, we believe we should engage with those who have been involved in bringing about or evaluating such experiments, pilots, and policies. Therefore, we interviewed 18 stakeholders mostly to understand how the cases in which they have been involved provide interesting information on the goals, contexts, methodologies, and of course implementation and aftermath of UBI experiments, pilots, and policies. Based on their comprehensive answers, and the literature on UBI and cash grants, we aimed to provide a set of findings and discussions that contribute to the ongoing debate on the benefits, hurdles, and legitimacy of conducting basic income experiments and pilots, but also in the assessment of basic income policies of basic income that have been implemented. In chapter 8, we summarize the main insights of the book and we highlight three main conclusions: the first and one of the key conclusions is the role played by the context. Our case studies cannot escape their context. The second conclusion is about the nature of our case studies. In fact, they share two features: (1) they are all social science experiments or policies which are being evaluated as such, which means they inherit the limitations of the methodologies employed in such experiments, and (2) they all differ from the definition of what a UBI is. In that sense, they should probably be called quasi-basic income experiments, pilots, or policies. The third is that none of our case studies has directly led to political implementation. However, they all have been influenced by political processes and agendas. Based on these three conclusions we argue that experiments can be justified as research, political, and advocacy tools if we take the limitations and considerations discussed in this book into account and include them in the way we design, implement, and evaluate experiments.

46.580757,-32.96235,3,"Introduction This paper examines the nature of &lsquo;free labor&rsquo; (Terranova, 2004) and its compensation in today&rsquo;s cognitive capitalism. (Boutang, 2011) Specifically, it tries to show how free labor involves into not only the generation of immaterial goods such as knowledge, information, culture, communication, relationship, and brand but also the production of various categories of material goods including motor cycles, medicines, musical instruments, and so on. In so doing, this paper explores how free labor of networked populations has been increasingly externalizing capital&rsquo;s management function from production processes and thus reinforcing the &lsquo;becoming rent of capital&rsquo;. (Vercellone, 2008) In addition, it enquires into the exploitation of free labor in conjunction with the notion of the voluntariness of labor and the immaterial compensation (e.g., reputation or peer recognition) that could be considered as major discursive resources for the reproduction of cognitive capitalism. Furthermore, by examining various strategies coping with the gratuitous dynamics of immaterial products facilitated by contemporary digital networking environments, this article tries to seek for a fair way to compensate for the free cognitive and affective labor. First, contents-vectoralists of music and film industries employ the legal device of &lsquo;Digital Rights Management (DRM)&rsquo; as a way to secure their profits. And thus, they are strengthening rent-seeking economy and constraining various forms of the long-standing cultural practices among populations. Second, &lsquo;Micropayment System&rsquo; is often regarded as a market-friendly solution to the gratuitous dynamics of digital labor by contents-vectoralists of journalism and publishing, many platform-vectoralists, and some libertarian consumer groups. Third, the concept of &lsquo;Universal Basic Income&rsquo; could be an effective social policy for the proper compensation for free labor in the sense that it extends the logic of social and common nature of production to the sphere of distribution. Background and Discussion Even though free labor in digital networks may not necessarily be unavoidable (Andrejevic, 2009), it still remains as an enforced labor in the sense that agreements of users on the terms of use set up by platform providers may be interpreted as a form of socially embedded enforcement. Furthermore, products of free labor are mostly put under a platform-vectoralists&rsquo; disposal. Similar to a contract of wage labor, users&rsquo; agreement on the terms of use enables platform providers to take a whole control over products of free labor. Indeed, private appropriation of social and common products of unpaid labor became a key object of exploitation in cognitive capitalism. So, here come two main reasons to think about a material compensation for free labor. First, even though much of free labor is not only performed by immaterial motivations such as a pursuit of technical perfection, an acquirement of reputational capital, and the spread of commonism but also compensated in an immaterial manner, it is far from the socio-economic norm of a fair distribution of wealth that platform-vectoralists appropriate the value created by free labor as a form of rent. Second, it is much more necessary to compensate for free labor in a material manner so as to secure the sustainability of cognitive capitalism itself that strives to retain sources of capital accumulation from the creative and innovative free labor among networked populations. The private appropriation of free labor has long been pursued by contents-vectoralists with an ownership of intellectual property rights and DRM might be deemed to be the most recent technological device for that purpose. DRM is mainly led by contents-vectoralists such as Disney, Warner Brothers, EMI, Microsoft, and Amazon and supported by major manufacturers of electronics including Sony, Samsung, Apple, IBM, Panasonic, and so on. Although contents-vectoralists have been trying to limit networked populations&rsquo; free access to ideas and information by introducing DRM, this privatization of digital commons may result in the blocking of creativity and innovation that are vital to the reproduction of cognitive capitalism. With regard to the notion of &lsquo;Micropayment System&rsquo;, some argue for charging all information, knowledge, and culture that is shared on the Internet free of charge and Micropayment System often considered as a proper way to compensate monetarily those who contributed to value creation in digital networks. In spite of the past failures of start-ups such as BitPass, FirstVirtual, Cybercoin, Millicent, Digicash, Internet Dollar, and Pay2See, some newspapers actively seek for a building of payment system to each news articles so as to relieve the company&rsquo;s financial burden. New York Times and Financial Times are currently running &lsquo;Metered Paywalls&rsquo; model and many more newspaper capitals are expected to join the track. And &lsquo;Google Wallet&rsquo; seems to providing a new momentum for the spread of Micropayment System. Meanwhile, it constitutes another reason for the idea of Micropayment System that many criticize platform-vectoralists such as Google and Facebook for their monopolization of the profits coming from the use of huge user-generated data on the Internet. Several social network services (e.g. Teckler, Pheed, Datacoup) actually run the business model which get back some of their profit to their users as a form of payment for using their personal data. Even some consumer activists refuse the highly common and idealized concept of &lsquo;freedom of information&rsquo; and &lsquo;free information&rsquo; since it enables, to a great extent, platform-vectoralists with a huge networking power to use and capture users&rsquo; value-creating activities free of charge. So, in order to realize information economy in which a new middle-class can emerge, we need, some argue, to renounce the familiar concept of &lsquo;free information&rsquo; and to employ a universal Micropayment System. (Lanier, 2013), However, Micropayment System, on the one hand, must disentangle a very complicate matter of ownership of immaterial goods and, on the other hand, inevitably require the establishment of an highly intensive digital surveillance system. Thus, this market-oriented solution for the compensation could not serve as a viable alternative. Conclusions Basic Income, as a way for a social and common compensation, may be able to deal with failures of rent-seeking economy developing in the sphere of culture and information beyond the realm of natural resources. It may also play a significant role in the realization and spread of social value of a common cultural inheritance. The concept of Basic Income is often justified in two different ways. First, all economic wealth and value is generated by social cooperation. That is, the creation of wealth should be considered not in terms of the product of individuals&rsquo; laboring power but in terms of social bond and cooperation among individuals. Therefore, every individual is deemed to retain the right to acquire wealth from these social and common resources. Second, key elements of production (e.g. tools, technology, and knowledge) belong to a communal cultural tradition and human heritage. So, we are all just cultural inheritors of human community and have to right to receive dividends. These two justifications of Basic Income seem to have a great relevance to today&rsquo;s cognitive capitalism. Its accumulation regime greatly relies upon the production of immaterial goods such as information, knowledge, and culture and its mode of production increasingly focuses on cooperation among networked populations. Furthermore, given the increasing flexibilization of employment relationships and differentiation between internal and external labor markets, universal Basic Income may play a crucial role in relieving the instability of cognitive capitalism.

While these views and the notions of freedom they endorse are distinct, it is argued that when we trace some of the antecedents of the capability approach notably in the works of Karl Marx these approaches are more closely connected than one might expect from an exchange between Philip Pettit and Amartya Sen. It is, for this reason, unsurprising that Pettit uses the capability approach in advancing his Republican view, though in ways which are quite different from Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's specific proposals.

-33.296085,25.768118,4,"This article reviews the burgeoning emerging literature on sustainable degrowth. This is defined as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that increases human well-being and enhances ecological conditions at the local and global level, in the short and long term. The paradigmatic propositions of degrowth are that economic growth is not sustainable and that human progress without economic growth is possible. Degrowth proponents come from diverse origins. Some are critics of market globalization, new technologies or the imposition of western models of development in the rest of the world. All criticize GDP accounting though they propose often different social and ecological indicators. Degrowth theorists and practitioners support an extension of human relations instead of market relations, demand a deepening of democracy, defend ecosystems, and propose a more equal distribution of wealth. We distinguish between depression, i.e. unplanned degrowth within a growth regime, and sustainable degrowth, a voluntary, smooth and equitable transition to a regime of lower production and consumption. The question we ask is how positive would degrowth be if instead of being imposed by an economic crisis, it would actually be a democratic collective decision, a project with the ambition of getting closer to ecological sustainability and socio-environmental justice worldwide. Most articles in this issue were originally presented at the April 2008 conference in Paris on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity. This conference brought the word degrowth and the concepts around it into an international academic setting. Articles of this special issue are summarized in this introductory article. Hueting, d'Alessandro and colleagues, van den Bergh, Kerschner, Spangenberg and Alcott discuss whether current growth patterns are (un)sustainable and offer different perspectives on what degrowth might mean, and whether and under what conditions it might be desirable. Matthey and Hamilton focus on social dynamics and the obstacles and opportunities for voluntary social action towards degrowth. Lietaert and Cattaneo with Gavaldà offer a down-to-earth empirical discussion of two practical living experiments: cohousing and squats, highlighting the obstacles for scaling up such alternatives. Finally van Griethuysen explains why growth is an imperative in modern market economies, raising also the question whether degrowth is possible without radical institutional changes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.01.014,Crisis or opportunity?

-47.015953,15.025584,1,"The government of Finland has the ambition of making Finland the first fossil-free welfare state in the world and reaching carbon neutrality in 2035. Simultaneously, worktime reduction and basic income have been matters of vivid political debate. Both worktime reduction and basic income are go-to solutions for post-growth scholars as ways to arrange welfare in a non-growing economy. These initiatives could thereby support the climate goals of the government– but are concerns with limits to growth distinguishable in the debates? In this thesis, I have mapped out the political debate in Finland surrounding the welfare reforms of worktime reduction and basic income to explore how growth-sustainability tensions are addressed and if welfare alternatives are limited due to the growth paradigm.

To see whether post-growth ideas are present in Finnish party politics, I interviewed eleven candidates from seven parties in the Finnish parliament to see on which grounds these initiatives are proposed and opposed. I found that the main driver of the debate is the transformation of work in the 21st Century, rather than the ecological crises we are facing. Most interviewees did not link Finland’s environmental goals to the two welfare initiatives discussed. Nevertheless, a minority considered basic income and worktime reduction to be sustainability strategies. There is recognition of limits to growth among politicians, and possibly more broadly in the parties they stood election for.

It appears that the growth paradigm is being politically contested. Although most respondents considered economic growth as a solution to social and ecological problems, growth was given instrumental value rather than being blindly pursued. The welfare state of Finland is embedded in a system depending on growth, whereby there is concern that current levels of welfare cannot be realised in a non-growing economy. Thereby the barriers to transition are more structural than narrative, although the latter was also distinguishable in the data.

I conclude that concerns with limits to growth are present in Finnish party politics. The political discussions on worktime reduction and basic income would benefit from including the potential co-benefits between social and environmental sustainability that post-growth scholars argue these initiatives have. This connection is however not without tension. As alternative methods of financing the welfare state have not been convincingly mapped out, reliance on growth to solve ecological and social problems is likely to continue.",,Is the time for leisure now? : The growth paradigm in the Finnish welfare debate,https://openalex.org/W3041431126

It discusses the implications of each on notions of and reform efforts for social or distributive justice. The core critique is that neither Van Parijs nor Zucker come to terms adequately with absolute poverty when addressing issues of income inequality. Reducing income inequality, a worthy goal for a variety of reasons (e.g., equalizing access to political power, creating greater social harmony), may reduce relative poverty while nonetheless ignoring absolute poverty. The author argues that poverty reduction should remain the central focus of theoretical and practical initiatives justifying income redistribution. That is, attending to basic need is necessarily elemental, can be made consistent with the idea of a UBI, and enhances the force of the concept of social or distributive justice.

Most developed nations provide financial assistance to persons with limited abilities. In 1974, an Icelandic government passed an act of law providing a tax credit, payable to taxpayers under certain conditions. The tax allowance was applied first to settle the taxes and public levies owed by the taxpayer, with any amount remaining paid out to the individual. This system can be seen as a first, limited attempt at establishing a partial universal basic income of sorts. This social interaction between stakeholders on how to share the tax revenue between the taxpayers led to a government crisis. The shareholders in this partial universal basic income system, the state and municipalities, the old age community, the trade unions, and the employers all have different financial and political interests and were affected by this reform. The lesson is that a basic income would need strong supporters if implemented, where the role of the government and/or the parliament would be mapped. Its supporters must be able to withstand the pressure from the social partners in the labor market because of the interactivity of the social security system and the pension fund system, which is not a part of the fiscal system in Iceland.

28.690374,-20.938246,0,"Debates on the gendered effects of universal basic income (UBI) tend to bifurcate into two opposing views. On the one hand, UBI is seen as a strong incentive for women to stay at home and be permanently locked into their care responsibilities. On the other hand, UBI is seen as a tool for empowerment, increasing women's autonomy, fortifying their capacity to act, and guaranteeing their individual income and income security. This paper contributes to these debates by asking if UBI enhances women's empowerment or not. Using the survey data compiled in the context of the Finnish basic income experiment (2017-2018), we compare survey responses from the UBI treatment group (n = 586) and the control group (n = 1047). Our results based on χ2 statistics and regression analyses show that, while UBI did not affect employment, it was positively associated with individual capacities and confidence in various aspects of life. However, these empowering effects were universal and did not differ between women and men. Our results indicate that UBI is not a gender equality-related issue in established gender-equal Nordic welfare states.

Not only does this contrast with the prevailing global trend of retrenchment in public welfare systems, but the proposed ‘basic income grant’ in South Africa is an innovation that remains a fringe idea even in the established welfare states of the North. The very unusual agenda for welfare reform in South Africa is based on the fact that the country already has a welfare system that is exceptional in the world, including especially a non‐contributory old‐age pension that provides a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly, and financial assistance to poor parents with children and to the disabled. The basic income grant has been proposed, most recently in 2002 by the Taylor Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security for South Africa, in order to fill the gap caused by high unemployment in South Africa's existing welfare system, which is otherwise already generous and redistributive. Whilst the proposed basic income grant is the key item on South Africa's innovative reform agenda, the country is also making important contributions to broader debates over welfare through its mix of familial, state and private responsibilities.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02533950208458731,The Broader Importance of Welfare Reform in South Africa,https://openalex.org/W2166303988

This being the situation, in which we can consider the problem of unemployment as being long-term and widespread, there are three possible sceneries, each having their own particular interventional policies. Policies of the first sort aim to change the supply for work both through a radical deregulation of the industrial relationship system, and through a reduction in social expenses. The second possible scenery proceeds from the belief that an increasing demand for private goods and services is inadequate, and suggests solutions that rely on the demand for goods, while developing at the same time the advanced infrastructures and the supply for collective services. Meades notion of Citizen's Income represents the third alternative scenery, where the social contract is no longer founded on the right to a job, but on the right to an income.

Historians’ attention has largely focussed on the formation of the Child Poverty Action Group and its long campaign to persuade Harold Wilson and James Callaghan’s Labour governments to introduce a universal Child Benefit. The most radical response to the poverty problem, however, came from the Conservative government led by Edward Heath, which published plans to replace the whole system of personal tax allowances with reversible tax credits. This article examines the origins of the Heath government’s Tax Credit Scheme, which promised both to reduce the cost of tax administration and to alleviate the ‘poverty trap’ created by means-tested benefits such as Family Income Supplement. It argues that the development of the Tax Credit Scheme in 1971–2 signalled the abandonment of the selectivity agenda with which the Conservatives had taken office in 1970, and so can be seen as one of Heath’s many ‘U-turns’. As the plans took shape, however, the cost of introducing the reforms on a no-losers basis became a source of growing concern within the government. Treasury officials were therefore relieved when Labour’s victory in the February 1974 election made it possible to jettison the scheme and retain the cumulative Pay-As-You-Earn system.",https://doi.org/10.1093/tcbh/hwv042,‘The Pragmatist’s Solution to Poverty’: The Heath Government’s Tax Credit Scheme and the Politics of Social Policy in the 1970s,https://openalex.org/W2268635547

Dr. ERICHARLA RAJU ABSTRACT India has the second largest concentration of tribal population in the world next to Africa. For centuries they lived a life of geographical isolation. In India primitive tribes have lived for thousands of years in forests and hills without any type of contacts with centers of civilization.

42.083652,-26.65155,3,"Abstract Liberal critics often object to basic income (BI) on the grounds that it violates reciprocity and is biased toward those who choose voluntarily to opt out of work and thus violate the principle of liberal neutrality toward conceptions of the good life. In the first part of this paper I argue that liberal neutrality favors BI. Marxist critics of BI are less likely to accept liberal neutrality, but I argue in the second part that the argument for BI in the first part applies with equal force to Marxist objections that BI is unfairly exploitative of workers. Marxists are also less likely to accept current labor market trends, seeing socialism as affording more opportunity for guaranteeing everyone a right to decent work, and suspecting BI of making the unfair inequalities of capitalism a little more palatable while diverting attention from a more equitable socialist alternative. I argue that BI is not incompatible with socialism or Marxism, and should not be opposed to but rather combined with strategies for full employment. Keywords: basic incomeliberalismMarxismsocialismworkreciprocityexploitation Notes 1 An earlier version of this paper appears as ""Liberal and Marxist Arguments for Basic Income,"" in Guy Standing (forthcoming). I am grateful to David Schweickart for presenting a series of objections to basic income that inspired the second part of this paper; these objections are explicitly addressed in the first part of the book chapter. For helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper, I thank Steve Pressman and two anonymous reviewers, participants in the USBIG Conference, New York City, March 2002, the BIEN Congress, Geneva, Switzerland, September 2002, the Radical Philosophy Association Conference, Providence, Rhode Island, November 2002, and the University of Maine Philosophy Department Colloquium, February 2002. 2 For an argument that such neutrality leaves the theory indeterminate with respect to some central questions of distributive justice, see Howard (Citation1984a). 3 See Van Parijs 1990: 106. At the high end, Robert Schutz (Citation1996: 14 – 15) optimistically estimates that each adult could receive $30,000 of unearned income. Schutz does not explore possible disincentives to work or misallocations of labor that might diminish over time the total available for distribution, other than to point out that people work for many reasons besides money and that automation can replace the more expensive and undesirable jobs. 4 Objections to a participation income, as attractive as it might seem in principle, are of a more pragmatic character. See below. 5 I am not sure which traditions they speak for, but there are many distinguished thinkers who have endorsed a right to unconditional income, including Bertrand Russell (Citation1935), Paul LaFargue (Citation1986), and Nobel economists James Tobin (Tobin et al. Citation1967; Tobin Citation1998), Herbert Simon (Citation2001), and James Meade (Citation1989). Thus it seems hazardous to maintain that anyone who thinks this way adheres to a conception of the good life that is beyond the pale of liberalism. 7 Philippe Van Parijs, correspondence quoted in Torisky (Citation1993: 296). 6 This is not an argument for the capitalist's contribution. On the contrary, often the contribution of capital involves no contribution of the capitalist. From the standpoint of justice all such assets are collective property. Even when these assets are institutionalized in the form of private property, cooperative property, or state property, we must not lose sight of the requirement of justice to equalize the opportunities associated with control over such assets. 8 See van der Veen and Van Parijs (Citation1986) for an argument for BI as a step toward this ""communist"" principle of justice. 9 I owe this objection and many of the other objections addressed in this section to David Schweickart's comments (Schweickart Citation2000) on my book (Howard Citation2000). In this book I defend a form of worker-managed market socialism, together with a basic income. 10 Barry (Citation1996) makes a pragmatic case for basic income. 11 The jobs people price themselves into at the lower end of the job market will be part-time, temporary, and more lowly paid. On the one hand, some see this as a desirable situation both for employers who seek more flexible labor markets, and for those employees who seek a more flexible work schedule to accommodate family and other priorities. On the other hand, critics see BI as here facilitating the erosion of good jobs—jobs that are well-paying, permanent, and full time, and the entrenchment of two-tiered labor markets. However, BI is compatible with a policy of promoting full employment of the more robust sort, aiming at full-time, regular employment for all who seek it. The worker's right to refuse undesirable forms of employment, which BI strengthens more the higher its level, should lead many employers to offer more ""good"" jobs in order to attract workers. The issues raised here underscore that BI needs to be part of a package of measures that includes labor market policy. 12 Roemer estimates the annual dividend on non-financial, non-farm corporate and non-corporate wealth per adult in the 1980s to be about $1,200, if these assets were to be nationalized and distributed equally (1994: 133 – 143). A real world example of a citizen's dividend is the Alaska Permanent Fund, which grants to every resident of Alaska an unconditional income based on investments from the Alaskan oil revenues. Current information on the Alaska Permanent Fund can be found at the following web site: www.apfc.org/ The dividend in 2002 was $1,540.76 per resident. 13 For a higher estimate, based on Clark's data, see Harvey (Citation2003). 14 For the bottom quintile, the average household income would increase by $9,613, for the second, by $7,250, and for the third, by $4,262 (Clark Citation2003: 150 – 152). For analysis of who would benefit from a more modest, tax neutral BI for the United Kingdom, see Atkinson (Citation1996). 15 This is not to imply that these wages were determined by the needs of workers' families, rather than the bargaining power of the workers. The decline in such bargaining power has forced both members of two-adult households into the labor market. 16 One such critic of the right to work is Standing (Citation2002), cited in Harvey (Citation2003). 17 For these and other important points in support of a right to work, see Harvey (Citation2003).",https://doi.org/10.1080/00346760500364775,"Basic income, liberal neutrality, socialism, and work",https://openalex.org/W2006832733

6.741868,16.241945,5,"Basic income has attracted the attention of academics, policy makers, and politicians around the globe. Basic income—a no-strings-attached cash transfer made to all citizens of a country, rich or poor—has been lauded as a plan to eliminate poverty, reduce income inequality, redress imbalances in the labor market, remedy the impending problem of mass technology-induced unemployment—the “robot apocalypse”—and make possible meaningful lives for those otherwise dependent on menial work in the labor market. It has also been proposed as an efficient, nonpaternalistic, and stigma-free alternative to existing welfare state policies. This Article compares basic income to an alternative policy proposal: the regulation of maximum working hours in the labor market. This Article contends that on nearly all of these virtues, working-time regulation does better than, or at least as well as, basic income. In particular, working-time regulation makes “free time” available to a broader array of individuals, also addresses technological unemployment, and is much more conducive to pro-environmental policies. Most importantly, it is more deeply egalitarian than basic income, not only addressing income inequality but social inequality, as well. Although basic income and working-time regulation are not necessarily incompatible—indeed some have advocated the adoption of both policies—there may be other factors that effectively render them policy substitutes. Specifically, not only is working-time regulation more complementary to existing welfare-state policy than is basic income, but—already in existence in the U.S. and most other developed countries—it also does not face the challenges of political and economic feasibility that confront basic income. Thus the choice and comparison is a compelling one, of which legal, policy, and tax scholars should take note.",,"Better than Basic Income?

First, the conditionality on nature and climate outcomes appears to contradict the defining criterion of unconditionality of a BI, although this contradiction may be resolved in those cases where the expected outcomes are only implicit. Second, the ecological outcome of BI remains elusive about decoupling of emissions and biodiversity loss from economic growth.

More recently, mainstream economists have begun to suggest some 'secular' limits to growth. Declining growth rates have in their turn been identified as instrumental in increased inequality and the rise of political populism. This paper explores these emerging arguments paying a particular attention to the dynamics of secular stagnation. It examines the underlying phenomenon of declining labour productivity growth and unpacks the close relationships between productivity growth, the wage rate and social inequality. It also points to the historical congruence (and potential causal links) between declining productivity growth and resource bottlenecks. Contrary to some mainstream views, this paper finds no inevitability in the rising inequality that has haunted advanced economies in recent decades, suggesting instead that it lies in the pursuit of growth at all costs, even in the face of challenging fundamentals. This strategy has hindered technological innovation, reinforced inequality and exacerbated financial instability.

What is new is the scale of these problems, particularly access to water for the poorest of the poor. This paper discusses the various conceptual responses to the water problématique, including the commodity, public and social approaches. The human rights aspects of the latter are analysed in some detail in light of the recent General Comment on the Right to Water by a United Nations body. The paper argues that countries have international legal obligations, to respect, protect and fulfil this right without discrimination, that carry clear implications for policy and practice. While the report does not argue that this human right requires the complete decommodification of water or that it provides a 'magic bullet' solution, it seeks to show the benefits of a human rights approach and provides some suggestions for implementing the right at the local, national and international levels.

Our analysis employs data from the panel survey “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS). These data have the key advantage that the collection in 2020 started prior to implementation of the first COVID-19-related policies. This situation enables us to apply a difference-in-differences approach to investigate the causal change in subjective well-being. Our results suggest that well-being declined during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we find no difference in this decline between BIS recipients and other German residents.

38.24261,40.230774,2,"In Basic Income. A Radical Proposal for a Free Society and a Sane Economy, Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght table two arguments that focus explicitly on the European Union. Their first argument concerns strategies to introduce basic income at the national level: VP&V argue that there is a tension between national basic income and the European principle of free movement; to cope with the threat of selective immigration, the sustainability of national basic income imposes ‘firm limits on hospitality’. The second argument concerns the introduction of a pan-European basic income: VP&V contend that pan-European basic income is the best answer to social challenges created by European integration. In this paper, I develop three claims. My first claim is that VP&V are unclear about the consequences of ‘firm limits on hospitality’ for the European principle of free movement: this renders their case ambiguous with regard to a core feature of the EU. National basic income seems incompatible with a consistent and legitimate logic of free movement and non-discrimination; to support this claim, I sketch a normative framework with regard to free movement and non-discrimination. My second claim concerns VP&V’s case for pan-European basic income. If it is true that the EU’s principal justice-related problem is that European integration has diminished core capabilities of national welfare states, such as national redistribution and national stabilization, without adequately ensuring their functioning at a higher level, the remedies to that problem are essentially different from a pan-European basic income. My third claim concerns both national basic income and pan-European basic income. The starting point of VP&V’s case for basic income is compelling: we all benefit from a common inheritance, for which none of us did anything. However, more arguments are needed why basic income should be the priority amidst competing claims on the ‘gift’ constituted by past technological, economic and social progress. In fact, the need to add a social dimension to the European project militates against rather than in favour of basic income, be it national or pan-European.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3011847,Basic Income in the European Union: A Conundrum Rather than a Solution,https://openalex.org/W2765891321

Recent calls for a guaranteed annual income (GAI), defined as regular income provided to citizens by the state regardless of work status, raise questions about the impact, relative to the costs, of such a population health intervention. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of Canadian seniors' benefits (Old Age Security/Guaranteed Income Supplement, analogous to a GAI program) on the self-reported health, self-reported mental health and functional health of age-eligible, low-income seniors.We used the 2009-2010 Canadian Community Health Survey to examine unattached adult respondents with an annual income of $20,000 or less, stratified by seniors' benefits/GAI eligibility (55-64 years: ineligible; 65-74 years: eligible). Using regression, we assessed self-reported health, selfreported mental health and functional health as measured by the Health Utilities Index, as outcomes for seniors' benefits/GAI-eligible and -ineligible groups.We found that individuals age-eligible for seniors' benefits/GAI had better health outcomes than recipients of conditional income assistance programs. Eligibility for seniors' benefits/GAI after age 64 was associated with better self-reported health, functional health and self-reported mental health outcomes, and these effects were observed until age 74.Using seniors' benefits as an example, a GAI leads to significantly better mental health and improved health overall.

The analyses, anchored in Veit‐Wilson's notion of discourses, show that the absence of governmental MIS in Israel has not been incidental, but the outcome of repeated conscious decisions, anchored in the primacy of the asocial economistic discourse.

The expenses of the redistribution pertaining to basic goods, as well as those associated with public (non-basic) but vital goods, are separately estimated by transforming the expenses into functions of the poverty line. The findings reveal that, along the poverty line that treats all citizens equally, the politicians representing opposing ideologies decide how the redistribution of basic and vital goods should be financed. Politicians should come to an agreement, subject to an approval of their decisions by voters-citizens. However, in the absence of such approval, politicians have no alternative but to continue the negotiations.

Society would benefit from the open discussion of alternative policy approaches, such as Universal Basic Income (UBI), that could alleviate social tensions related to increasing wealth inequality and potential joblessness that have become more problematic due to automation and technological advance. 
Objective: In this study, we examine the discussion of UBI on Twitter in an effort to understand the types of messages most likely to spread information about policy innovations, and most likely to bring new voices into the discussion. Society would benefit from the open discussion of alternative policy approaches. For example, one such prescription is UBI, which involves giving each citizen above a certain age a set income, regardless of work status or wealth. 
We have seen the potential for social media sites such as Twitter to draw attention to the grievances of activists in recent social movements. Policy advocates, like political activists, could benefit from research that provides insights into how ideas and messages spread, and ways to grow their audiences. Much work has examined factors related to message diffusion on Twitter. 
The diffusion of ideas and information can instigate social change. This paper used structuration theory to illustrate how this happens, suggesting that as information flows through our networks it can both re-instantiate and transform social norms. It re-instantiates norms by showing us what we expect to see; what we would think of as normal behavior for a given situation. This framework informs our research questions: 1. Are more retweet event (RTEs) labeled interesting than other types, and specifically, more than resonance? 2. Are tweet messages coded as resonance retweeted more than those coded as interesting? 3. Do RTEs labeled as resonance tend to bring more new users than other types, particularly those labeled interesting? 
Data: We collect and analyze tweets related to Universal Basic Income and use both content analysis and inferential statistics. We collected Tweets from Twitter’s streaming API using an open source toolkit developed by a co-author. Our collection period spanned from July, 25, 2016 to December 12, 2016, involving 157,832 tweets posted by 35,102 users. 
Method: The researchers coded a sample of 1000 tweets independently successfully testing for intercoder reliability. 
Results: The results imply that part of the building of activist networks is the long hard work of trying to get content to spread over weak tie bridges in ways that build one’s audience and reduce the length that information has to flow to reach new potential audiences. 
Relevance: We apply Roger’s theory of the diffusion of innovations from the field of communication to understand the diffusion of policy ideas on Twitter. Given the recent discussion of the diffusion of fake news, this work is timely as it sheds light on the kinds of messages that diffuse in networks as well as which types of messages tend to bring more new users into a discussion space. We further discuss the impact of Twitter on the policy discussion of Universal Basic Income. This leads to prescriptions for policy advocates wishing to grow their audience and network.",,An Analysis of Diffusion of Universal Basic Income Policy Over Twitter,https://openalex.org/W2982088323

28.724283,-19.486557,0,"The article examines the problem of the feasibility of a universal basic income (UBI) in modern society/world. Three main aspects of this problem are formulated: the feasibility of implementing UBI, taking into account the relationship between the positive and negative socio-economic effects of this measure; the degree of compliance of UBI with the institutional system of modern society; possibility of financing UBI in the amount of the subsistence minimum. The controversial impact of UBI on public welfare, economic growth and the lifestyle of members of society is revealed. Arguments are given in favour of the compatibility of UBI with the functioning of the labour market. A conclusion is drawn about the potential predominance of the positive effects of using UBI in the context of an established understanding of development as a person gaining freedom. There has been a tendency to provide socially significant benefits (education, medical care) to all members of society, regardless of their income level. Using the example of family capital analysis, the illegitimateness of linking social security only with the task of poverty reduction is substantiated. UBI is presented as a logical step in the implementation of the trend towards universal social support. The role of the minimum wage (SMW) as a state-guaranteed basic income for a worker is analysed. The need to pay UBI to employees along with the minimum wage has been questioned. The difference is shown between the current practice of using the minimum wage and the implementation of the minimum wage as a form of UBI (earnings in the amount of a share of the minimum wage for part-time employment, the possibility of wage arrears). Measures to overcome this difference are justified (salary at a level not lower than the minimum wage, regardless of the amount of time worked, payment of UBI from a special fund during the period of arrears in wages, with subsequent reimbursement of these expenses to the fund at the expense of the employer).&#x0D; It is proposed to include a state-guaranteed basic income as an element in all types of income from economic activity. Calculations are presented showing that the total costs of paying UBI in the amount of the subsistence minimum will amount to about a third of household expenditures on final consumption in GDP, that demonstrates the possibility of financing UBI.

This article addresses this gap by employing a conjoint experiment fielded in Finland, where a UBI has received significant media and political attention. Our findings show that the most contentious dimension of a UBI is – surprisingly – not its universality, but instead its unconditional nature. Individuals are more likely to support policies that condition receipts upon searching for employment or being genuinely unable to work, and less likely to support policies that are fully unconditional. On the funding side, support tends to be lower for a UBI that is linked to reducing existing benefits, but higher if the UBI is to be funded by increasing taxes, especially on the rich. These findings contribute to a wider literature on the politics of UBI and to our understanding of the potential popularity of competing policy reform alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1177/09589287211072638,"What’s not to like?

Poverty is still widespread and unemployment has remained high with women and youth being particularly affected. In 2002, the Namibian government’s Tax Commission proposed a universal cash grant as the most effective way to fight poverty and to reduce inequality. In 2004, the Basic Income Grant (BIG) Coalition was formed consisting of churches, trade unions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in support of the proposed grant. It implemented a pilot project to practically demonstrate the effects of the grant. The chosen location was the village of Otjivero where each inhabitant received a monthly cash grant of N$100 (US$9)beginning in January 2008. A research team closely monitored developments and found that within one year the rates of poverty, child malnutrition and school drop-outs had fallen significantly. Economic activities increased, school results and residents’ health status improved while the crime rate and women’s economic dependency on men were reduced. Despite these results, the Namibian government did not implement the BIG and the coalition failed to ignite a mass campaign. The country’s largest trade union federation did not play an active role and its leadership withdrew from the coalition despite support for the BIG among union members.

This idea has been around for a long time and was first formulated more than two centuries ago. There have been several times when it has attracted attention over that timespan, and these bouts of interest typically coincide with a specific and recurring combination of circumstances. The current wave of interest began about three to four years ago, in the aftermath of austerity, and is now coming to a peak with serious prospects for some form of UBI being adopted as the official policy of more than one political party. Interestingly, the idea has support from both left and right but also attracts hostility and criticism from both sides, with some of the most trenchant criticism coming from the left. In discussing the idea of a UBI it is very important to be clear as to what it is that we are talking about, as several similar but ultimately different kinds of proposal are often grouped under the same umbrella term. A survey of the proposals currently put forward in the UK, and of the responses to them, reveals both a mixture of motives behind the advocacy of such schemes and the serious problems, both practical and principled, that they pose. On the left, such suggestions are frequently contrasted with a rival kind of proposal, that of Universal Basic Services (UBS), which is in many ways a revival of a much older tradition of socialist thought, but there is no such clear alternative on offer from the free-market side.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3852056,Universal Basic Income: Is it a Good Idea?,https://openalex.org/W3181073417

We specifically selected this time period as it includes both Andrew Yang’s UBI campaign during the Democratic primaries in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when UBI gained attention due to the federal government’s unconditional cash payment to almost all citizens. To overcome the limitations of sporadic opinion polls, we built on a recent development of the rescaling method to generate longitudinal Google Trends and conducted Twitter sentiment analysis. We observed a modest rise in public interest in UBI during Andrew Yang’s campaign, especially in blue states, and a significant increase across all states at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are three policy choices to resolve this issue: (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work, and (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason. Of these choices, article 8 of the Part-time Labor Act adopts (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, and the Democratic Party of Japan's manifesto (2009) extols the basic principle of same pay for same work (one form of (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work). A general legal principle based on a particular form (same career or same work) is not applicable to other types of employment systems and creates the problem of not being able to address the various benefits not directly connected to career or work duties, such as commuting allowance, in-house cafeterias, and health examinations. While France and Germany have adopted (2) the general legal principle of same compensation for same work, their systems, in fact, operate in line with (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason in order to resolve the issue. With an assumption of diverse and broad benefits for employees and diversified and multi-track human resource systems (wage systems), Japan has also adopted (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason; responses that incorporate diversity of particular situations for determining objective reason are likely appropriate in terms of theory and practice.

The chance is indirectly assessed by an exercise in which 50 percent of actual tax revenues generated by indirect taxes of member states is collected at the center and distributed equally to all citizens.

The impact of 21st-century technological progress on employment has only just begun to make itself felt and it will take time to realize its full extent. However, the main innovation is already common knowledge: robots (and artificial intelligence) are finding their way into the production process. According to several recent (although controversial) contributions, the phenomenon is radically different from past technological revolutions and could generate high levels of unemployment, calling for innovative redistributive public policies. The present article, building on Keynes’ (1930) short essay (“Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren”) and referring to some of the principles and models of behavioral and happiness economics, focuses on the best-known of these policies, namely provision of an unconditional basic income. A series of factors – loss aversion and hedonic adaptation, the impossibility of escalating to higher-grade consumption behaviors, social interaction in the form of active and passive envy, loss of self-esteem and social stigma – are all likely to have a negative impact on well-being if an unconditional basic income that remains unchanging over time is implemented.

A larger basic income grant (even at the level of the food poverty line) would threaten fiscal sustainability as it would require large tax increases that would crowd‐out consumption and investment.

The current article contributes to existing knowledge by studying public support for basic income from a multidimensional perspective, using a vignette experiment that charts popular support for a broad range of differently designed types of basic income. The results demonstrate that support for basic income is indeed inherently multidimensional, for three main reasons. First, some types of basic income are more popular than others, especially those that are conditional and equity-based. Second, people make significant trade-offs between various policy design dimensions and the deservingness criteria associated with them. Third, there are important differences in the types of basic income preferred by specific ideological groups: while left-wing people differentiate little between various proposals, their right-wing counterparts clearly prefer more-restrictive proposals. By situating these findings in a comparative perspective, the article proposes a novel conceptual framework, which postulates that the multidimensionality of support for basic income is context dependent.

Australia gradually lost ground in this arena compared with other developed countries. The election of the Whitlam Labor Government in 1972 presented Australia with the first reform oriented government since the end of the Second World War: a considerable number of suggestions were put forward to extend and improve social welfare programs. 

This study investigates those suggestions which dealt with the development of more comprehensive income maintenance programs. It looks, in particular, at the proposal made by the Poverty Inquiry to introduce a Guaranteed Minimum Income - and examines why it (or a similar scheme) was not implemented and what, if any, ideological obstacles to its introduction remain relevant in the last part of this century. But before that can be done, it is necessary to examine the existing system of income maintenance, its structure, the mechanisms which create that structure, and to ascertain what makes the present system of income maintenance attractive to many people.

Attitudes to work, the family and the way social need is viewed affect the public's preparedness to support welfare initiatives; these attitudes are considered preliminary to an examination of a number of generalised income guarantee proposals. The history of income guarantee schemes suggested in Britain, the United States of America and Australia is provided as a backdrop against which the ideological debates which such proposals evoked are assessed. 

The analysis of the ideological obstacles to income guarantees in Australia reveals the impediments embedded in the existing system of income maintenance and shows that these are not contained within the central tenets of Marxism, liberalism or social democracy. They are to be found associated with conservatism and discrimination based on gender, age, race, and locality. 

Before proceeding to estimate the likely response of either the Labor or Liberal Parties to income guarantees, the study establishes that there is no inherent incompatibility between the Australian mode of production and such guarantees.

Should we stick to a generous welfare state with a sizeable basic income, but high marginal tax rates for the lower incomes and thus little incentives to work? Or, should we “make work pay” by subsidizing the work of low earners, but possibly at the cost of a smaller safety net? We think it is difficult to answer this question without making clear what individuals are (held) responsible for and what not. First, we present a new fair allocation, coined a Pareto Efficient and Shared resources Equivalent allocation (PESE), which compensates for different productive skills, but not for different tastes for working. We also characterize a fair social ordering, which rationalizes the PESE allocation. Second, we illustrate the optimal second-best allocation in a discrete Stiglitz (1982, 1987) economy. The question whether we should have regressive or progressive taxes for the low earners crucially depends on whether the low-skilled have a strictly positive or zero skill. Third, we simulate fair taxes for a sample of Belgian singles. Our simulation results suggest that “making work pay” policies can be optimal, according to our fairness criterion, but only in the unreasonable case in which most of the unemployed are not willing to work.",,Is it fair to “make work pay”?,https://openalex.org/W3123055964

The argument is based on a Rawlsian conception of justice as the establishment of a basic structure of society that guarantees a fair distribution of primary goods. We propose that the decline of the welfare state witnessed in Western countries over the past forty years prompts a reassessment of the boundaries of the basic structure in order to include additional corporate institutions.

-1.7568387,15.684924,1,"The present study examined the historical basis of the Australian disability income support system from 1908 to 2007. Although designed as a safety net for people with a disability, the disability income support system within Australia has been highly targeted. The original eligibility criteria of permanently incapacitated for work, medical criteria and later partially capacitated for work potentially contained ideological inferences that permeated across the time period. This represents an important area for study given the potential consequence for disability income support to marginalise people with a disability.

Social policy and disability policy theorists, including Saunders (2007, Social Policy Research Centre [SPRC]) and Gibilisco (2003) have provided valuable insight into some of the effects of disability policy and poverty. Yet while these theorists argued for some form of income support they did not propose a specific form of income security for further exploration. Few studies have undertaken a comprehensive review of the history of disability income support within the Australian context. This thesis sought to redress these gaps by examining disability income support policy within Australia. The research design consisted of an in-depth critical historical-comparative policy analysis methodology. The use of critical historical-comparative policy analysis allowed the researcher to trace the construction of disability within the Australian disability income support policy across four major historical epochs. A framework was developed specifically to guide analysis of the data. The critical discourse analysis method helped to understand the underlying ideological dimensions that led to the predominance of one particular approach over another. Given this, the research purpose of the study centred on: 

i. Tracing the history of the Australian disability income support system.
ii. Examining the historical patterns and ideological assumptions over time.
iii. Exploring the historical patterns and ideological assumptions underpinning an alternative model (Basic Income) and the extent to which each model promotes the social citizenship of people with a disability.

The research commitment to a social-relational ontology and the quest for social change centred on the idea that   has to be a better way in the provision of disability income support. This theme of searching for an alternative reality in disability income support policy resonated throughout the thesis. This thesis found that the Australian disability income support system is disabling in nature and generates categories of disability on the basis of ableness. From the study, ableness became a condition for citizenship. This study acknowledged that, in reality, income support provision reflects only one aspect of the disabling nature of society which requires redressing. Although there are inherent tensions in any redistributive strategy, the Basic Income model potentially provides an alternative to the Australian disability income support system, given its grounding in social citizenship. The thesis findings have implications for academics, policy-makers and practitioners in terms of developing better ways to understand disability constructs in disability income support policy. The thesis also makes a contribution in terms of promoting income support policies based on the rights of all people, not just a few.",,"Australia's disabling income support system : tracing the history of the Australian disability income support system 1908 to 2007 : disablism, citizenship and the basic income proposal",https://openalex.org/W157840315

Point of departure is an economy with job scarcity. A fair way to deal with job scarcity is to grant everybody an equal right to work, where these rights can be freely traded. It turns out that such a Labour Rights scheme and a basic income scheme are equivalent. The equivalence is that the price of Labour Rights and the unemployment benefit corresponds to the income tax rate and basic income respectively. The tax rate can thus be considered as what workers have to pay to appropriate scarce job assets. Both schemes allow that some people voluntarily abstain from doing paid work, in return for a financial compensation. Therefore, the advantages in terms of equity and efficiency of a Labour Rights scheme equally apply to the basic income proposal. This analysis provides an argument against cutting unemployment and social assistance benefits during economic downturns and it offers new insights to evaluate the parasitism and exploitation objection raised against basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0770451800010800,"Basic income, unemployment and job scarcity",https://openalex.org/W2038433219

A number of provisions of the tax code are tied explicitly to child age and dependent status. Changes in the ages of children can thus affect marginal tax rates through phase-in or phase-out provisions of tax credits or by shifting individuals across tax brackets. We identify the response of labor and income to these tax changes by comparing families who experienced a tax rate change to families who had a similar change in dependents but no resulting tax rate change. A primary advantage of our approach is that the changes are anticipated and therefore should not cause re-evaluations of lifetime income. The estimates of substitution effects should consequently not be confounded by life-cycle income effects. The empirical design also allows us to compare similar families and can be used to estimate elasticities across the income distribution. In particular, we provide estimates for low and middle income families. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we estimate an intertemporal elasticity of family labor earnings close to one for families earning between $30,000 and $75,000. Our estimates for families in the EITC phase-out range are lower but still substantial. Estimates from the IRS-NBER individual tax panel are consistent with the SIPP estimates. Tests using alternate control groups and simulated placebo tax schedules support our identifying assumptions.

The planetary boundaries help to quantify the ""ceiling,"" while the social protection floor concept operationalizes the linea de dignidad, the minimal conditions for a dignified life. In order for Western societies to respect these limits, significant institutional change is needed with respect to both orientations and mechanisms. For the ceiling, this article suggests a shift to an orientation of ""better but less"" for affluent groups, and toward ""enough and better"" for those still living in poverty. The corresponding mechanisms include a redistribution of income and wealth, a cap on income, an unconditional minimum income, and a strengthening of democracy. The choice of instruments has to take into account that consumption is to a large degree not an individual but a social act and to employ informational, financial, and legal measures that overcome the preference of decision makers for market instruments.

The speed and severity of the viral contagion has rendered devastatingly, undeniably visible the vast, racial gap between those with reliable health care, child care, housing, nutrition, household wealth, and income and those without, but that gap was already widening well before the pandemic amid accelerating economic inequality, racial disparity, and precarity for those fortunate enough to find paid work. By the summer of 2020, pandemic isolation gave way to mass protests supporting the Movement for Black Lives with calls to end anti-Black police brutality and mass incarceration, but also seeking to end exploitation of Black essential workers and increase attention to longstanding economic devastation of divestment from communities of color. With physical health and safety linked inextricably to material deprivation came heightened public demands for racial, social, and economic justice to help marginalized communities not just survive in times of crisis, but thrive every day. This Article examines reinvigorated proposals for universal basic income (UBI) and a federal job guarantee (JG) to reduce poverty, income inequality, and the widening racial wealth gap. It examines the potential of such reforms to put more money into the hands of those most likely to use it while ending involuntary unemployment and boosting labor conditions for all, but especially Blacks and people of color with less access to generational wealth, higher education, and protection against employment discrimination. It concludes that both UBI and JG are necessary but each insufficient on its own to achieve greater economic security and mobility, with dignified work for all.

A detailed description of labor’s share of national income in 16 industrialized democracies from 1960 to 2005 uncovers two long-term trends: an increase in labor’s share in the aftermath of World War II, followed by a decrease since the early 1980s. I argue that the working class’s relative bargaining power explains the dynamics of labor’s share, and I model inter- and intra-class bargaining power in the economic, political, and global spheres. Time-series cross-section equations predicting the short- and long-term determinants of labor’s share support most of my theoretical arguments and the main findings are robust to alternative specifications. Results suggest that the common trend in the dynamics of labor’s share of national income is largely explained by indicators for working-class organizational power in the economic (i.e., unionization and strike activity) and political (i.e., government civilian spending) spheres, working-class structural power in the global sphere (i.e., southern imports and foreign direct investments), and indirectly by an indicator for working-class integration in the intra-class sphere (i.e., bargaining centralization).",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122410382640,"Good Times, Bad Times",https://openalex.org/W2033648564

In the first, Sheila Shaver reviews the conflicting arguments for Participation Income and Basic Income, both of which claim to represent extensions of the social citizenship of the welfare state required for a post-industrial society. The paper reviews the reforms introduced in the Working Nation White Paper, and suggests that these are part of a large scale historical shift in the character of the Australian welfare state. While social rights of citizenship such as income support were previously complementary to employment and capital accumulation, they are now becoming integrated into the processes of economic growth and development. The paper by Peter Saunders focuses on Basic Income (BI) and two key issues which must be addressed in all such proposals, conditionality and transition. Conditionality refers to the definition of those circumstances under which people are entitled to receive income support benefits. BI proposals have also given insufficient attention to the problems associated with the transition to such a scheme, and in particular to the political influence of estimates of winners and losers. Advocates of a Participation Income such as Atkinson and Cass accept some degree of conditionality as the price of BI at an adequate benefit level; this paper offers an alternative proposal for a low level but fully unconditional BI, which is considered a more promising approach to the problems of transition.",,Two Papers on Citizenship and Basic Income,https://openalex.org/W1566976738

We consider a framework in which the planner uses the collected tax revenue to intervene in either prevention (aimed at reducing the rate of infection) or treatment (aimed at increasing the speed of recovery). Both optimal prevention and treatment policies allow the economy to achieve a disease-free equilibrium in the long run but their associated costs are substantially different along the transitional dynamic path.

In Western Europe, although there is variation, welfare has become conditional for social assistance recipients  the ""socially excluded."" Social assistance is administered at the municipal level, which contracts with private companies. Caseworkers are supposed to make individualized contracts emphasizing work activities. This paper examines the field-level data in several US programs and finds that there is a symbiotic relationship between governments and contractors; caseworkers, whether public or private, focus on process rather than substantive plans; government does not question the data; contracts are imposed; the most employable are placed; and the most vulnerable are sanctioned or otherwise not allowed on welfare. Research in some European countries is showing similar results  activation programs are difficult to administer and increase the risks for the most vulnerable.

The aims were to make it easier for claimants to claim benefits, to make the gains to work more transparent and to reduce the amount spent on administration and lost in fraud and error. More households will see entitlements rise from the move to Universal Credit considered in isolation than will see entitlements fall; in aggregate, entitlements will rise by nearly £1.1 billion a year.

In envisioning the world at 2050, we envisaged future growth in four possible directions: growth without limits, growth within limits, stagnation, and New Welfare. The scenario considered as preferable reflects a transition toward a New Welfare, characterized by a high level of cooperation, heightened concern for the environment and for social welfare, and an increased share of immaterial consumption. This scenario is based on the recognition that the development of new technologies – although relevant – turns out to be insufficient to resolve the issue of resource scarcity alone. Important behavioral changes are also needed. In the New Welfare scenario, GDP as a measure of growth becomes obsolete and needs to be replaced with ways of measuring progress that are more reflective of natural, human, and social capital. The New Welfare scenario also charts a pathway toward a low-carbon future, with an overall reduction in energy consumption, density, and intensity, and a greatly reduced reliance on fossil fuels. A new, smart electric grid facilitates active demand management and decentralized production of power. Natural gas or even small nuclear plants tackle problems associated with the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Among other likely shifts under this scenario is a re-conceptualization of production, from short-lived to longer-lasting goods and from private to open source knowledge products and services; growth in recycling and zero-waste processes; and a shift from profit-driven business to entrepreneurship that seeks to satisfy social needs and build local capital. The world undergoes a transition from unequal growth to prosperity in a multi-polar, globally interdependent world. New global democracy networks and institutions are created, and constitutions extend beyond the protection of human rights to the recognition of “nature rights.” Citizens’ income is tied to the social welfare-oriented duties and participatory governance. This scenario further leaves room to new forms of self-regulation of common resources. Actions necessary for the shift to the New Welfare paradigm include the adoption of new metrics for measuring progress, measures to increase public acceptance of technological and societal change, the creation of new global and local institutions devoted to sustainable management of shared environmental resources, sustainable production and consumption patterns, and a low-carbon energy and transport systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2013.10.019,The world in 2050 and the New Welfare scenario,https://openalex.org/W2091378366

Sustainable welfare is a novel research field that seeks to close this knowledge gap and develop integrated eco-social policies. Within this, researchers are starting to ask how citizen’s needs can be guaranteed in an environmentally sustainable way and how their welfare benefits should be delivered. Should citizens receive a universal basic income, be given vouchers for ecologically beneficial or socially needed goods and services, or be provided with access to socio-ecological infrastructures and services? This article develops a framework for sustainable welfare benefits with six criteria of sustainable welfare and nine different types of welfare benefits that belong to the domains of universal basic income (UBI), universal basic services (UBS), and universal basic vouchers (UBV). Using this framework, existing policy proposals are categorized and evaluated. The advantages and disadvantages of the different types of welfare benefits are discussed and new application areas highlighted. The analysis shows that a successful policy will likely include all forms of welfare benefits, with certain types being more adequate for certain fields and societal circumstances. The framework for sustainable welfare benefits can serve as a starting point for further research on integrated policy design and inform policymakers on the selection of eco-social policies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12020596,"Money, Vouchers, Public Infrastructures?

In connection of the exacerbation of the global problem of poverty and property inequality, the crisis of existing social welfare systems, the attention of scholars and practitioners is focused on finding new tools for social protection of the population. As a consequence, scientific research and practical experiments on the introduction of unconditional basic income in the world are being updated. The purpose of the article is to substantiate and determine the prerequisites for improvement of the social security system of the population based on the concept of basic income in Ukraine. Results. The relevance of the study of the preconditions, advantages, potential results and problems of introduction of unconditional basic income in Ukraine are substantiated. The authors consider the theoretical grounds for the expediency of its application in our country to compensate citizens for lost access to natural resources in an oligarchic-clan economy. An ability and sources of financing of unconditional basic income in Ukraine are analyzed. It is proposed to improve the taxation system (introduce a progressive income tax rate scale) and fiscal instruments (in particular in the area of natural resource rentals) for this purpose. The prerequisites for the introduction of basic income are defined: a high level of civic awareness and economic consciousness of the population, a stable and effective tax system, the deduction of income and property. Based on the analysis of the social structure of the population of Ukraine, its citizens’ self-assessment of their incomes, the assumption is made about the inefficiency of basic income as a stimulator of human capital development in the direction of entrepreneurship and creativity in the short term after its introduction. It is suggested that basic income in Ukrainian realities can have a positive effect on solving problems such as labor emigration, demographic situation, decline of the Ukrainian village, which requires appropriate social experiments. Conclusions. As a result, it is concluded that the use of unconditional basic income in Ukraine in combination with other social transfers is feasible under the conditions of: reforming the system of taxation and payments for the use of natural resources; legalization of shadow income; raising social standards to an objective level of satisfaction of human physiological and spiritual needs; strengthening the control over the efficiency of use of budgetary funds; stimulating investment in human capital; infrastructure improvements; raising the standard of living of the poorest population groups.

It answers in the negative, because the classic morality of social insurance and social assistance—under which citizens have rights to a robust social minimum, and reciprocal obligations to contribute to the social product in some fashion when possible—is still quite compelling. Part II asks whether a UBI may nevertheless be a practical necessary soon, whether due to automation or the obsolescence of classic welfare state policies. Regarding technology, I argue that there is simply no evidence that a historically unprecedented automation wave is underway, or on the horizon. Regarding the welfare state, I argue that growing inequality and precarity today are not an inevitable result of the decline in manufacturing, but rather an effect of policy choices, especially choices to disempower labor. The conclusion then argues that the better way to deal with today’s problems of work and economic inequality is by building a more social democratic welfare state: one organized around generous benefits that ensure individuals’ basic needs are met and that help de-commodify labor, strong worker rights including powerful and robust unions, and policies that facilitate labor market participation.",,Basic Income and the Resilience of Social Democracy,https://openalex.org/W2902241800

However, several studies evaluated the mental health outcomes associated with payments provided unconditionally, and consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental wellbeing. Potential mediating factors included improved time with family and friends, a reduction in perceived stigma and a renewed sense of hope for the future.Our review has produced evidence to suggest that prophesies surrounding the mental health benefits of a UBI are at least partially justified.

All European societies are involved in extensive discussions about reforming of current social welfare system. One proposal is the introduction of unconditional basic income (UBI). For the first time cross-national comparative data on population’s support for UBI were collected in European social survey (ESS, round 8, 2017–2018) in 23 European countries including Russia. The data analysis described in the article shows that cross-national differences in the support for introducing basic income scheme in Europe are unexpectedly high taking into account relative novelty of this idea in public debate and its radical character. Several hypothesis about the reasons and factors driving cross-national differences in attitudes toward UBI schema were suggested and discussed in the articles using ESS data including the hypothesis of economic affordability and the impact of general economic prosperity, the hypothesis of the need for social support, satisfaction with current national welfare system and demand for more extensive welfare programs and the hypothesis of national social-historical experience. Data shows that UBI schema is supported by young Europeans more than by older age groups. Popular support for the introduction of UBI schema in Russia is one of the highest in Europe. Regression analysis of ESS survey data provides evidence that high level of dissatisfaction and high demand for radical reforms of national social welfare system and more social justice in the distribution of national wealth contribute to the popular support of UBI idea in Russia.",https://doi.org/10.31857/s013216250008321-6,A Comparative Analysis of Popular Attitudes toward the Idea of Universal Basic Income in Russia vs Europe,https://openalex.org/W3172435365

The palette of the obtained expert assessments, generalized and systematized in the following areas, is shown: 1) UBI criteria; 2) Russia's readiness for the introduction of UBI; 3) current challenges for Russia (priority goals of the introduction of UBI, forms of implementation, sources of funding, method of implementation, experiments on the introduction of UBI); 4) risks and positive effects of the introduction of UBI. It was revealed that a common position among experts regarding Russia's readiness to introduce UBI has not yet been formed: almost half of the interviewed experts spoke in favor of the feasibility of implementing transitional forms of UBI in our country, a slightly smaller group of experts believes that Russia is not ready to introduce UBI in principle. Experts associate the primary goals of the possible introduction of UBI in Russia, first of all, with the mitigation (overcoming) of the problems of poverty and socio-economic inequality, ensuring a minimum standard of living for vulnerable categories of the population, ensuring social justice (the right to life, equal opportunities).

Consequently, it is the lack of mainstream employment options, rather than the presence of the CDEP scheme that drives the social pathologies identified in recent public debate.

For the effective implementation of this system, a high level of public consent is required, since it will affect all social groups. According to the Russian Social Survey (RSI) under the ESS programme, support for UBI among the Russian population is one of the highest in Europe. Most of all, UBI is supported by young people. Based on the tenth wave of RSI, hypotheses about the grounds for the formation of attitudes towards UBI among Russian youth were tested - the utilitarian-pragmatic theory of interests, the value theory and the “level of opinion formation” hypothesis. Significant differences were found in attitudes towards UBI between gender groups, people with different levels of education, economic status, different family structure, experience of unemployment and work-life balance. Among the value factors, support for measures to reduce economic inequality and the value of independence showed the strongest relationship with a UBI. However, in general, the first two hypotheses cannot convincingly explain the phenomenon of support for UBI among young people. The results of cognitive interviews conducted as part of the CESSI-Monitor national survey showed that the opinion about UBI among young people in Russia is still poorly formed. The majority of respondents gleaned basic information about UBI from the very name of the concept during the interview. Positive opinion about UBI arose due to the idea of ​​guaranteed additional income mentioned in the name. Such aspects as unconditionality and universality either have not yet found understanding or are perceived contradictory. Those who view a UBI as a system of equitable distribution of natural resource rents and national wealth have a positive attitude towards the idea of universality and equality in the distribution of such income. Those who emphasise the fact that UBI is funded by taxpayers perceive the idea of inclusiveness and equality without regard to merit and need negatively. In general, low awareness of UBI and poorly formed opinions lead to its instability. New arguments and clarifications can significantly change the picture. Therefore, it is still premature to talk about deep support for the UBI idea among Russian youth.",https://doi.org/10.19181/vis.2023.14.4.3,"Attitude of Russian Youth to the Idea of Unconditional Basic Income – Understanding, Motives, Misconceptions",https://openalex.org/W4390190891

If this were true, implementation of a UBI may not be sustainable. To do this, we will compile empirical evidence from studies over the last few decades on the effects of implementation of a UBI on employment. We apply the PRISMA methodology to better judge their validity, which ensures maximum reliability of the results by avoiding biases and making the work reproducible. Given that the methodologies used in these studies are diverse, they are reviewed to contextualize the results taking into account the possible limitations detected in these methodologies. While many authors have been writing about this issue citing experiences or experiments, the added value of this article is that it performs a systematic review following a widely tested scientific methodology. Over 1200 documents that discuss the UBI/employment relationship have been reviewed. We found a total of 50 empirical cases, of which 18 were selected, and 38 studies with contrasted empirical evidence on this relationship. The results speak for themselves: Despite a detailed search, we have not found any evidence of a significant reduction in labour supply. Instead, we found evidence that labour supply increases globally among adults, men and women, young and old, and the existence of some insignificant and functional reductions to the system such as a decrease in workers from the following categories: Children, the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying.

40.496067,-5.0290504,2,"Proponents and opponents of a universal basic income all acknowledge that the most significant political challenge to its adoption in the United States is that a universal basic income would not have a work requirement attached. Often, this is characterized as a problem involving incentives—the availability of a universal basic income would cause many people to stop working (or significantly curtail the number of hours that they work) and simply live off the universal basic income. This Article makes three contributions to the literature related to a universal basic income: First, it provides a typology for understanding the many reasons for valuing work; second, it argues that the United States is unlikely to implement a universal basic income because a universal basic income does not account for several aspects of the value of work; and, third, it argues that advocates of a universal basic income should instead focus on the more modest goal of redefining the activities that constitute work and broadening the social safety net by expanding existing policies through the use of a broader definition of work. This Article proposes that the value of work in American political culture has four primary dimensions: 1) reciprocity, that one receives rewards for one’s labor, that one gets what one gives and that no one should be a free rider, one who gets but does not give; 2) calling or vocation, that work is a calling or vocation that one should have or pursue, and that only those that have or pursue such a calling or vocation have moral standing; 3) self sufficiency, that work promotes self sufficiency, which is a necessary component of liberty and which is necessary to avoid dependency; and 4) incentives, of an economic kind, that society should encourage work because it increases the size of the economic pie. These categories provide a new framework for thinking about the value of work and for evaluating policies that relate to the working lives of Americans. As an alternative to the adoption of a universal basic income, this Article proposes that proponents of a universal basic income should focus on expanding and redefining current policies, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit so that they more closely resemble a participation income. In fact, a broader definition of work has even been used in recent conservative policy ideas, such as the Medicaid work requirements that some states have introduced, which include within their definition of work the activities of education, job training, and community service. This Article closes with an outline of a proposal to adopt an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit that resembles a participation income and addresses each of the dimensions of the value of work.",,Something for Nothing: Universal Basic Income and the Value of Work Beyond Incentives,https://openalex.org/W3122070636

Authoritarian work conditions violate overlap but distinct values, related to democratic government, meaningful work, non-domination, exploitation, and the quality of leisure time. To the degree that democratizing work is supposed to advance these values, a basic income is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for eliminating authoritarian work conditions. It might, in some conditions, reduce some of the worst aspects of our current workplace relationships. But, by the same token, it might exacerbate them, especially if a basic income becomes a substitute for collective self-organization by workers.

The draft law ""Basic Income of a Citizen of Ukraine"" (hereinafter - BSGU) is similar in form to BBDG and at the same time conceptually adapted to Ukrainian realities. Its adoption will be followed by the Constitution of Ukraine (Chapter II Rights, Freedoms and Duties of Man and Citizen).The subject of the research is the model of introduction of the basic income of a citizen of Ukraine - the law №1 for Ukraine. Goal. The article aims to describe the general, basic and final provisions of the draft law № 1 for Ukraine ""On the introduction of basic income of Ukrainian citizens"" which will contribute to the opening of new opportunities for Ukrainian citizens in health, education, self-realization through innovation and suffrage, will help to stop the outflow of labour and intellectual potential from Ukraine, providing each part of the total gross domestic product. The object of the study is the mechanism of introduction of the basic income of a citizen of Ukraine. Local self-government and the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine). Open-source materials were used for the study, namely summary information from the official website of the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture of Ukraine, DW website referring to the data the World Bank and 112ua, Constitution of Ukraine. In addition, the emergence of such a law will open new opportunities for citizens of Ukraine in health, education, self-realization through innovation and suffrage, where you can not only freely choose but also be elected to public authorities at various levels, will help to suspend the outflow of labour and intellectual potential from Ukraine, providing each part of the total gross national product. Methods. The following methods were used to conduct research and obtain its results - the method of analysis and synthesis, absolute and comparative advantages, socio-psychological and organizational-administrative methods, synergetic approach. Research results. Public organizations, journalists, and representatives of local self-government were involved in the discussion of the proposed bill. The result of the study is a peer-reviewed scientific development - the draft law ""On the introduction of basic income of citizens of Ukraine"", information on copyright and related rights is included in the bulletin № 61 and are considered published November 30, 2020, National Intellectual Property State Enterprise. Conclusions. Every year more and more people have temporary or part-time employment. Forms of labour relations are changing. Labour relations based on remote employment are spreading. The structure of labour collectives is modified and they begin to lose a clear organizational structure and disappear as a whole. Society is increasingly stratified by income. Every year artificial intelligence becomes a growing driver of technological progress in our progressive digital civilization. Already in the 1920s, global automation of labour processes will take place, which will lead to a significant reduction in the number of jobs. Scientists predict that by 2035, 70% of current jobs, including those related to routine manual labour, will be replaced by artificial intelligence. Under the above circumstances, states face problems of increasing the natural rate of unemployment due to a significant increase in the level of structural unemployment. That makes it necessary to provide more and more assistance for integration into society to people who have lost the prospect of employment due to the disappearance from the labour market of jobs and specialities that they own. The above information does not mean that people will suddenly have nowhere to work. Today, new professions are emerging every day, and in developed countries, more than 70% of the economy is in the service sector. However, the transition period, until people lose their main jobs and find new jobs, will be not only painful but very massive. This process will be accompanied by mass strikes, rallies, voting for populists and other destructive phenomena of socio-political development. Every year we witness the growing impoverishment of citizens, so the decision was made to initiate a bill on the Basic Income of Citizens of Ukraine as a mechanism to ensure the main human right - the right to a dignified life under the Constitution of Ukraine (Article 21. All people are free and equal in dignity and rights).",https://doi.org/10.32447/20784643.24.2021.17,MECHANISM FOR INTRODUCTION OF THE BASIC INCOME OF A CITIZEN OF UKRAINE,https://openalex.org/W4206386357

The near collapse of economies with the attendant job losses has brought forth the need for effective social policies, particularly in developing countries, that can serve citizens in dire need. Consequently, many of these countries have had to craft emergency social policies to help their citizens. Ghana is no exception. While measures to control the spread of the pandemic, such as lockdowns and restrictions on movement and gathering, were timely, they negatively impacted the poor, most of whom work in the informal sector and depend on daily survival activities such as buying and selling basic goods. As a result, some of the measures were ignored as people feared they would die from hunger rather than from the pandemic. Thus, governmental response to the pandemic was highlighted by policy layering and exposed the fragile social support systems in existence. The challenges of responding adequately to the pandemic underscore the importance of a transformative social welfare regime in ensuring the protection of citizens. This paper, based on desk research, explores the limitations of the existing social policy framework, which became manifest during the implementation of Ghana’s pandemic policies.

Proponents point out that narrowly targeted programs exclude many of the poor. Critics point out that universality spreads limited resources thinly over the population limiting the impact on poverty for a given level of spending. While high income countries can claw back the transfer to the higher income group through a progressive income tax, this is not possible in developing countries where most people operate in the informal sector. This note looks at an alternative to either narrow targeting or UBI. It uses household survey data from 52 low and middle-income countries to compare the poverty impact of a UBI to a transfer that is gradually reduced as estimated consumption increases. The taper can be set at different rates and can lead to zero transfers to households above a chosen threshold. The tapered UBI (TUBI) can be based on proxy indicators for unobserved income from special surveys and administrative databases.

It is argued that, moral justifications notwithstanding, an open-ended commitment to either policy requires a clear grasp of its macroeconomic effects and institutional aspects. The tax-driven approach to money (also known as 'modern money') reveals that, while government funding for either proposal is not 'operationally' constrained, it produces disparate economic outcomes, depending on the program design of the universal guarantee. A modern money critique of the basic income proposal demonstrates that, in a monetary production economy, the unconditional supply of the monetary unit is inherently inflationary. By contrast, job guarantees can provide an important safety net by simultaneously stabilising prices. Additionally, job guarantees offer an institutional vehicle for achieving other social goals that are important to all advocates of universal assurances.

Since automation involves both winners and losers, and given that there is no 'end of work' on the horizon, it is argued that most normative views on the subject – i.e. the 'allocative' view of basic income, and the 'desirability' views of post-work and workist ethics – do not provide many resources with which to address unjustly unequal divisions of labour involved in technological innovation. This article problematises these common responses reframing the problem from the perspective of labour justice. While the allocative view assumes that labour justice follows 'spontaneously' from income redistribution, the desirability views are chiefly interested in either defining or contesting the meanings of work for individuals, overlooking the interdependent nature of work and concerns of equality other than autonomy. Two conceptions of labour justice are thus applied to the problem: Paul Gomberg's contributive justice, and Iris Young's democratic division of labour. Instead of deciding between them, the normative core of 'contributive parity' is suggested as a critical standard for assessing unequal labour structures, and for envisaging a future in which technology can be an ally in making social cooperation fair.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17496535.2018.1512141,"Automation, Labour Justice, and Equality",https://openalex.org/W2889167909

Most strongly manifest in earnings-related social insurance, the principle of reciprocity has been increasingly questioned on grounds of equity, adequacy and fiscal viability, in the wake of socio-economic changes (e.g. post-industralisation, globalisation) and political developments (e.g. Europeanisation). Universalist programmes seem extraordinarily expensive under tight public budgets, and could be criticised as inequitable at a time when middle classes increasingly rely on individual and occupational forms of income security. The principle of need appears to have become more prominent within modern European social security systems keen on targeting resources. Is there empirical evidence which would reflect these alleged trends? Concentrating on three principles inherent in social security transfers (need, universalism and reciprocity) the major concerns of this article are conceptual and empirical. First, it addresses the problem of operationalising social security principles and delineating indicators of change over time. Second, it applies two of these indicators in order to identify and compare the extent to which the three principles have gained or lost prominence since the early 1980s, with empirical evidence taken from the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia. The article argues first that, applying either indicator, there is no cross-national trend towards squeezing reciprocity-based social insurance, but that a convergence between erstwhile strong (Bismarckian) and weak (Beveridgean) principled programmes can be identified. Second, a clear trend towards needs-based social security can be identified within the ‘legal’ but not within the ‘volume’ perspective, at least in some programmes and some claimant groups. This is due to both policy changes and favourable labour market conditions. Third, two countries indicate very diverse trends. British social security is distinctive in terms of the erosion of Beveridgean reciprocity, as well as the growing strength of the needs principle. In the Netherlands, there have been considerable shifts in principles underlying certain programmes, but no general trend in either direction can be observed.

Thus far, there is nothing new in the emphasis on basic needs or on the eradication of mass poverty, for throughout the ages the poor have never been unheralded or unsung, however little their plight might have been heeded in actual human conduct. What is new are two comparatively recent perceptions: one, that science and technology can increase production everywhere on a scale that makes poverty unnecessary as a global phenomenon within the foreseeable future; and secondly, that scientific and technological advance no less than increases in employment and mass well-being require a certain social and political milieu.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-18358-6_11,"Employment, Growth and Basic Needs",https://openalex.org/W2497883657

Unemployment and poverty are known factors to have a negative impact on the well-being of a person. Contrary, high levels of well-being, flourishing, describes a state of optimally functioning in daily life and feeling good. The proposal of introducing an unconditional basic income (UBI), may solve problems as the unemployment trap and poverty and could act as a basis for flourishing. Via actively engaging in imagining a personal future with UBI, it was investigated how participants (n=14) throughout three age groups would imagine a future with UBI, how this future offers a possibility to flourish and how they assess an UBI in general. Results of the current study identified restraining factors on the well-being and show the imagined positive effects UBI could have on these factors. Further, young adults (16-24 years) were identified as a disregarded major beneficiary group. It was argued that current uncertainties were most severely experienced by younger adults. Middle-aged adults appeared to be most sceptical and less benefitting in regard to an UBI. The older generation (55 years and above) appeared to be most settled and an introduction of an UBI was considered to be least integral for themselves to flourish in the future. Yet, they appeared to follow higher needs with a focus on providing a basis for a flourishing society.

Our study modelled the impact of Universal Basic Income (UBI) – a largely unconditional, regular payment to all adult permanent residents to support basic needs – on mental health and mortality in young people. <h3>Methods</h3> We produced a discrete-time dynamic stochastic microsimulation that models a close-to-reality open cohort of synthetic individuals aged 14–24 (starting at 90,000) between 2010 and 2030 based on data from the Office for National Statistics and the Understanding Society/UK Household Longitudinal Study. Three UBI scheme scenarios were developed for use in the separate Landman Economics Tax-Transfer Model: Scheme 1 – Starter (per week): £41 per child; £63 per adult over 18 and under 65; £190 per adult aged 65+; Scheme 2 – Intermediate (per week): £63 per child; £145 per adult under 65; £190 per adult aged 65+; and Scheme 3 – Minimum Income Standard level (per week): £95 per child; £230 per adult under 65; £230 per adult aged 65+). Their effects on net equivalised household income distributions were modelled. These counterfactual distributions were then used in our microsimulation to project cases of anxiety and depression prevented or postponed and cost savings compared with the existing system. The model was developed in R v4.2.0. <h3>Results</h3> Over 20 years, from 2010–2030, 200,000 (95% Uncertainty Intervals: 180,000–210,000) cases of anxiety and depression could be prevented or postponed in Scheme 1. This would increase to 420,000 (400,000–440,000) for Scheme 2 and 550,000 (520,000–570,000) for Scheme 3. UBI would lead to 110 (0–430), 320 (0–640) and 420 (100–770) deaths prevented or postponed for schemes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In total, £330 m (£280 m-£290 m) in NHS and personal social services costs would be saved for Scheme 1 over 2010–2030, assuming 50% of cases diagnosed and treated, with Scheme 2 (£710 million [£640 m-£790 m]) or Scheme 3 (£930 million [£850 m-£1000 m]) producing much larger savings. Overall, the total cost saving would range from £1.5 billion (£1.2b-£1.8b) for Scheme 1 to £4.2 billion (£3.7b-£4.6b) for Scheme 3. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Our modelling suggests that UBI can significantly benefit young people’s mental health and will produce savings for the health and social care system as well as those incurred by patients. Policymakers should consider the potential mental health, fiscal, equity and well-being benefits of UBI.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2023-ssmabstracts.27,OP27 What are the impacts of universal basic income on mental health?

While accepting Fraser’s articulation of the dilemma, we resist her concluding that Sen’s capability approach is insensitive to cultural justice or the recognition of difference. There is no automatic guarantee, yet an intermediate theory of recognition or cultural justice could in theory be brought to bear on what is, after all, ‘a framework’. We argue that Fraser’s analysis is well suited to be such an intermediate theory, and propose a theoretical device for an evolutional perspective on redistribution and recognition. We concentrate on identifying the stage of the market process at which policy intervenes to remedy redistribution, and the stage of the communication process at which policy intervenes to remedy recognition.

This study analyzes how Canadian fiscal policy reinforces the many social, economic and legal barriers women face when they try to gain equal access to full-time work with equal pay, and examines structural proposals that would remove or reduce these barriers to women’s labour force participation. The author concludes that four basic structural changes should be made at once to reduce those barriers as much as possible: recast all the joint provisions in tax and social assistance law as individual provisions, permit secondary earners to claim all the actual costs of work-related expenses, reduce the marginal tax rates imposed on low incomes and eliminate the bias against women caused by the rules governing employee fringe benefits, employment insurance and retirement pensions. Failing the political will to take all these steps, the author proposes the enactment of an earned income credit that can be claimed by all secondary earners to ameliorate the existing fiscal barriers to women’s labour force participation.

However, the welfare state in the United States has been characterized as reluctant and exceptional due to the extent that it leaves basic needs unmet. Recently, even welfare states in other leading global nations have shown signs of faltering; for instance, Shahidi and colleagues (2019) found that social welfare is associated with adverse health outcomes and that social assistance recipients exhibit worse health outcomes relative to similar nonrecipients in many countries. Like other systems, welfare states and even their flagship programs must evolve with macro socioeconomic changes. In this column, I introduce an intervention strategy gaining traction through a growing number of pilot projects across the United States, universal basic income (UBI).

-1.9221652,-49.31127,0,"Poverty remains a persistent problem even in advanced economies, and Alberta is no exception despite robust long-term economic growth. Serious discussion of poverty reduction through a basic or guaranteed income has reemerged at the federal level and among the provinces, including Quebec and Ontario, coinciding with renewed efforts to address child poverty through the Canada Child Benefit and the Alberta Child Benefit. These relatively new income support programs provide federal and provincial tax credits that are refundable; that is, unlike many current nonrefundable tax credits, they provide a benefit to families that is larger the further their income lies below the level of the credit. This paper analyzes the prospects for Alberta poverty reduction today through a basic guaranteed income achieved by tax reform that would make most of the current existing nonrefundable tax credits refundable. 

Our paper demonstrates that a guaranteed basic income achieved by transforming most existing nonrefundable tax credits into a single refundable credit can have substantial impact on poverty in Alberta because it more effectively transfers the income support provided by these credits to lower-income families. Using version 26.0 of the Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M) from Statistics Canada, we are able to simulate the impact of various options for an Alberta Guaranteed Basic Income (AGBI) that might emerge from this tax change. Our analysis sets a budget for the AGBI based on current expenditures for the Basic credit and five other nonrefundable tax credits that have a total value of $5.36 billion in Alberta. For this budget, a wide variety of program options are available based on different combinations of an income guarantee that would be the maximum amount available to a family with no other income and a benefit reduction rate that reduces the income benefit as family income from other sources rises. We consider the impact of a variety of these program options along multiple dimensions, including the poverty rate based on Statistics Canada’s Low Income Cutoffs poverty line, the depth of poverty calculated as the amount by which family incomes fall below the poverty line, income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient, earnings from the labour market, and the distribution of beneficiaries. We illustrate our approach by choosing an AGBI with a relatively low benefit reduction rate of 10% that yields income guarantees of $6,389 and $9,305 for families with one and two adults, respectively. While our plan is illustrative, we argue that it is sensible in light of the inevitable trade-offs between changes in the degree of poverty reduction, labour earnings and the proportion of families that benefit from a program of this nature. The plan provides benefits to 37.3% of families, effectively delivers benefits to the families with the lowest incomes, and reduces the rate of poverty and its depth by more than 20%. Single parent families and non-elderly and elderly single persons benefit overall from the AGBI, and poverty is completely eliminated for single parent families.

We also consider an AGBI linked to a comparable federal plan, since the federal and provincial tax systems are integrated and the federal Liberal government has expressed interest in poverty reduction through a basic income. The federal plan we consider transforms the same set of nonrefundable tax credits as the provincial AGBI option and also eliminates the federal GST credit for a combined guaranteed basic income program budget of $11.36 billion for Alberta. We opt for a federal plan with a modest benefit reduction rate of 15% that provides income guarantees of $7,285 and $10,302 for families with one and two parents, respectively. The combined federal and provincial guaranteed basic income plans provide income guarantees of $13,674 and $19,338 for single and two-parent families with no other income and reduce the income support benefits at a moderate rate. Disposable income increases by 50.4% for the poorest 10% of families and by 6% for the next poorest 10% of families, and one-third of Albertans received benefits under the combined plan. As was the case for the provincial AGBI, single parent families and non-elderly and elderly single adults experience an overall increase in their disposable income but the poorest families receive significant benefits on average for all family types. The rate of poverty among all Albertans drops by 44% and is completely eliminated for single parents and non-elderly and elderly couples. While poverty remains for two-parent families and the non-elderly single person, its rate declines substantially and its depth is cut by more than half. The non-elderly single person, the family group that exhibits by far the most poverty, receives the most benefit from the combined plan, as the families with bottom 40% of incomes show gains on average in this group. Overall inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, falls by 2.2% compared to 1.6% for the provincial AGBI alone.

Our plan relies on the filing of an income tax return to obtain benefits. In this regard, it is worth noting that the rate of tax filing in Canada is very high, as about 95 per cent of persons 15 and over file a return. Those who don’t file a return and those whose incomes fluctuate can rely on social assistance as a source of income, as our plan would supplement that existing basic support program. In this regard, the provincial social assistance program could be used in concert with the AGBI to reach those who don’t file a tax return and those who require emergency funding within the taxation year because of a sharp decline in income. 

Our analysis has attempted to illustrate the impact that a straightforward tax policy change toward refundable tax credits can have on poverty in Alberta, particularly with federal participation in a comparable plan. As concerns about technological displacement of workers and rising inequality grow, discussion of the need for a guaranteed basic income is unlikely to abate, and we believe that tax reform to make existing tax credits refundable can be effective in delivering what amounts to a guaranteed basic income for families without serious economic disruption. Most Canadians now file taxes, making such a guaranteed basic income plan a sensible consideration for the future.",,An Alberta Guaranteed Basic Income: Issues and Options,https://openalex.org/W3139199866

3.3688748,-32.82346,0,"In the absence of an independent poverty standard, postwar British governments have tended to use current, politically determined social security scales (from Unemployment Assistance in the 1930s to Income Support today) as their definition of minimally adequate income levels, commonly known as an ‘official poverty line’. A basic principle of taxation since the days of Adam Smith, however, has been that incomes below the minimum income required for socially defined necessities should be free of tax. The personal tax allowance which determines the income tax-paying threshold thus also provides a practical definition of such an official poverty line. Royal Commissions and official committees since the nineteenth century have endorsed Smith's principle, but it only acquired major political significance after the Second World War when income tax began to affect low earners, particularly after the 1960s when poverty was ‘rediscovered’ in the UK. In spite of this potential coincidence of purpose, a review of evidence and interviews with officials shows that there has been no co-ordination of policy between the Treasury and Inland Revenue responsible for determining the level of the tax allowances, and the Social Security ministries responsible for the minimum benefit scales. The tax threshold has consequently continued to be determined by considerations of political economy and administration and not by the alleviation of poverty.",https://doi.org/10.1093/tcbh/10.2.218,"The Tax Threshold: Policy, Principles, and Poverty",https://openalex.org/W2131387292

We use survey data on reported voting behaviour in 22 direct democratic referendums on distributional issues between 1981 and 2004. Our two main findings are the following: (1) age seems to be the most relevant line of conflict in most distributional issues and (2) vertical stratification (income and education) and gender are less important in explaining individual voting decisions. Our data also suggest that material interests based on socio-structural characteristics account for only part of the variation in social policy preferences, and that value cleavages are also important.

We will start off on Sect. 7.1 by arguing that we still have important knowledge gaps on the impacts of unconditional cash transfers, and some results we already have might deserve more attention. Hence, we will argue that we do have enough information, but it tends to be scattered. The insights from this book aim to contribute to help us shed light on results from basic income experiments, pilots, and policies, which can hopefully also help us understand which results we know less about. In Sect. 7.2, we tackle the role of different stakeholders engaged in basic income experiments, pilots, and policies, namely researchers, politicians, communities, or the media. We discuss how particular goals often compete which can contribute to misperceptions on the success or failure of the experiment. We will argue that despite the difficulties in juggling the agendas and roles of different stakeholders, namely researchers and politicians, we should acknowledge these limitations and incorporate them in how we design, implement, and communicate the findings of any experiment or policy. Finally, in Sect. 7.3, we discuss what our interviewees told us about how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped the debate on basic income and particularly on the need to have UBI experiments.

This will help protect the unemployed from poverty and stimulate economic growth. Systematization of the literary sources and approaches for solving the problem of improving the quality of life of the poor indicates that the government (led by the African National Congress) since 1994 implemented a social security policy (the child support grant for women). At the same time, the government’s position regarding the feasibility of introducing of basic income grant as a tool for economic stimulation has changed. The African National Congress disagrees with the need for basic income grant as a tool for poverty alleviation and economic growth. The main purpose of the research is the analysis of the prerequisites for the change in the position of the African National Congress regarding the feasibility of introducing basic income grant: basic income grant is a tool for stimulating economic growth and overcoming poverty for most of the disadvantaged population of South Africa, or a means for the government to preserve its positions, which are weakening among the South African electorate. The paper presents the results of an empirical analysis, which proved that basic income grant will contribute to the increase of the national tax base as those not earning an income can start buying and selling goods and be taxed. At the same time, at the initial stage, the introduction of basic income grant will lead to an increase in the level of income taxation of the employed population. Analytical methods of scientific literature analysis became the methodical tools of the conducted research.

Contrary to expectations we derive from political theory and welfare state literature, our results based on data from the European Social Survey suggest that having high concerns about exploitation is positively correlated with support for UBI, whereas repression concerns are negatively correlated with support. In line with our hypothesis about social investment ideology, left-leaning individuals with efficiency concerns are more likely to support UBI.

Point of departure is an economy with job scarcity. A fair way to deal with job scarcity is to grant everybody an equal right to work, where these rights can be freely traded. It turns out that such a Labour Rights scheme and a basic income scheme are equivalent. The equivalence is that the price of Labour Rights and the unemployment benefit corresponds to the income tax rate and basic income respectively. The tax rate can thus be considered as what workers have to pay to appropriate scarce job assets. Both schemes allow that some people voluntarily abstain from doing paid work, in return for a financial compensation. Therefore, the advantages in terms of equity and efficiency of a Labour Rights scheme equally apply to the basic income proposal. This analysis provides an argument against cutting unemployment and social assistance benefits during economic downturns and it offers new insights to evaluate the parasitism and exploitation objection raised against basic income.",https://doi.org/10.3917/rel.703.369,"Basic income, unemployment and job scarcity",https://openalex.org/W3123850841

A highly simplified simulation model is developed in which individuals are homogeneous except for the wage they face, and there is a single means‐tested benefit. In this model, moving towards universal benefits can raise labour force participation and such effects can outweigh the labour supply reductions of working taxpayers. The number of losers is found to be quite small relative to the number of winners. If a fully universal system is not adopted, a move towards it, by reducing the taper on means tested benefits at the expense of a higher tax rate, can lead to significant winners without losers.

We start by asking to what extent moral and instrumental arguments are used to justify implementing these kinds of experiments and basic income-related policies. Although these two arguments mostly work together when experimenting, the second section of this chapter argues that scientists and politicians in charge of rolling out these experiments or implementing these kinds of policies differ in their respective logic and procedures, and these differences inevitably affect the design, implementation, and evaluation of basic income experiments and related programs. However, the decision to implement a basic income experiment is not solely explained by these different scientific and political decisions. The third section of the chapter addresses the role of the political scenario and the actual political debate in explaining when, how, and in what manner an experiment or a policy is about to be implemented, or on the contrary, why it is rejected. Moreover, the structure, logic, and functioning of the welfare regime model and of existing social policies also frame the discussion around the (in)convenience of implementing a basic income experiment or rolling out a similar in-cash policy.

26.682014,-26.303558,3,"Universal Basic Income (UBI) is   concept that has recently begun to enter the popular political consciousness in the United States. It is defined as a regular cash income paid to all, on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It is invoked for   wide variety of political and social purposes, but is almost always presented as radically different from existing governmental welfare and transfer systems. Once   UBI is disaggregated into discrete policy components, it is possible to imagine to what degree existing programs share the benefits (and detriments) of   UBI to   greater or lesser degree, and reforms could be made to make existing programs more UBI-like, if that would be beneficial. 

This Article re-envisions   UBI as   series of reforms to one of the largest existing governmental transfer program in the US: the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is   work-conditional transfer program, and so any UBI-like reforms to the EITC will lack the defining characteristic of   UBI - that is it not work conditional. On the other hand,   number of reforms to the EITC would make the program more UBI-like. These include: (i) that the EITC phaseout be removed so the program is no longer means-tested (no means testing); (ii) that the program benefit be applied on an individual basis, decreasing the importance of support of custodial children (individuality); (iii) that the administration of the program be reformed so workers can receive payments throughout the year (regularity). By starting with the EITC and proposing   series of reforms to make it more UBI-like, one is able to accurately assess the differences between   UBI and at least one large governmental transfer program, diminishing the impression that   UBI is too utopian to actually become reality. One is further able to build on decades of tax policy research about the successes and failings of the EITC.

Of particular importance to both supporters and critics of the UBI is its lack of work requirement, and that is often its most philosophically controversial element. By exploring UBI-like reforms to the EITC (which is work conditional), this paper relaxes   defining aspect of the UBI - that it be free from work requirements. For some supporters, this makes any comparison between the program proposed and   UBI nonsensical. But the EITC is already more like   UBI than many work-conditional transfer programs, and reforms could make its work-conditionality even less problematic. Still, maintaining the EITC's structure as   work-conditional transfer program distinguishes it dramatically from   true UBI, and loses   number of the central benefits of   UBI. It is the premise of this paper that an exploration of   partial UBI of this nature -   compromise - is useful for future discussion of the issue, even if the proposed program is   distinct second best. It is not   coincidence that Senator Kamala Harris,   contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has proposed   UBI-like program, the LIFT the Middle Class Act, which shares many of the features of the reforms proposed in this Article.",,EITC for All: A Universal Basic Income Compromise Proposal,https://openalex.org/W3123383287

UC aimed to reduce spending on welfare, but in doing so now threatens the stability of a functioning and cohesive society. Over recent years, and most notably during the COVID‐19 pandemic, it has become ever clearer that adequate social security is vital to the functioning of society, as well as to the health and well‐being of the population. Yet this period has also served to highlight the fragility and insufficiency of welfare in the United Kingdom. This article explores how the current welfare crisis, is associated with UC. In this article, we also consider the uncertainty that UC has created in most recipients. We argue that there are other ways to support the most vulnerable in society, and that we are now at that critical juncture in needing to make significant change. Universal Basic Income (UBI) offers one such alternative by offering stable, individual, non‐means tested, and unconditional money transfers, to all citizens. Over the last decade, there have been multiple experiments around the world trialling basic income, each of which has a specific focus, or target population, as different elements of a UBI were scrutinised. In this article, we reflect upon what we consider to be the potential shortcomings of the current welfare system in the United Kingdom as a move away from its origin, arguing that the United Kingdom is now primed for UBI to be considered a fair and legitimate way to provide social security.",https://doi.org/10.1111/spol.13002,Modern welfare in the <scp>United Kingdom</scp> is a universal (dis)credit to Beveridge.

-17.1556,-21.722492,0,"<h3>Background</h3> Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been proposed as an upstream intervention with pathways to health impact by reducing poverty and unpredictability. Microsimulation modelling has suggested significant impact on mental health, but there is also evidence to suggest prospective impact on physical health, especially in terms of ‘lifestyle’ conditions. With increased recognition of the need for prevention, and the Welsh trial of basic income for care leavers under way, there is need among public health policymakers to understand community understanding of prospective impacts and social feasibility of UBI. <h3>Methods</h3> The NIHR has funded a series of citizen engagement workshops within Jarrow, Tyneside, in the North East of England. Jarrow sits within the 19<sup>th</sup> most deprived local authority, South Tyneside, within the UK. Two sets of citizen engagement groups were held in January and February 2023, with 20 participants divided by generation (baby boomer, generation x, millennial and generation z) into facilitated groups. The first set examined implications of local schemes designed for community-level impact; the second examined community-level impacts of national policy. Data were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. <h3>Results</h3> Data support elements of previous research, but also indicate two findings of importance to health policy. As in recent studies conducted with young people in Bradford (Johnson 2023), there was clear recognition of the potential health benefits of UBI, mainly mediated through a reduction in stress for those in and out of work and increased long-term health-promoting behaviour. However, there was a significant concern i) about the potential for recipients to be victims of acquisitive and violent crime during randomized trials and ii) about UBI’s potential impact on bingeing behaviour and addiction, which is not prominent in the literature. These are crucial concerns, given high rates of crime and drug and alcohol use within low-income communities and their role as social determinants. <h3>Conclusion</h3> This study demonstrates the potential public health benefit of cash-based upstream interventions, but also the complexity of implementing schemes in ways that do not inflict harm. There is need for more robust evidence on the role of sudden income increases on short-term, health-diminishing behaviour through crime and drug and alcohol misuse. This highlights the importance of PPI in considering the safety of recipients in design and implementation of trials, especially in communities vulnerable to changes in resource.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2023-ssmabstracts.31,OP31 Universal basic income and health – strong support and distinctive concerns from a deprived community in NE England,https://openalex.org/W4386117868

To begin dealing with the poverty part of that dreaded triad, the Committee of Inquiry into Comprehensive Social Security in South Africa (the Taylor Committee) recommended that a basic income grant (BIG) be introduced. The primary purpose of the BIG, as the Committee understood it, was to address the problem of destitution in South Africa, consequent largely upon mass unemployment. Although it was argued that it would have developmental effects, the BIG was not seen as being able to eradicate poverty - the poverty gap is simply too large to make politically feasible the redistribution through the fiscus required each year to do so. The BIG can veradicate most destitution, and lift as well, some substantial number out of poverty.2 Cabinet's initial reception of the Taylor Committee's recommendation was lukewarm.3 Demands for a basic income grant (BIG) have, however, not yet been rejected outright. Instead, the BIG is either slighted; damned with faint praise; or worried over as being either (a) being unaffordable, and/or (b) likely to cause 'dependency'. On the former score, there is little cause for concern - the BIG is affordable (Meth 2003a). The current package of measures designed to address poverty - education and training, limited grants, the social wage, and the extended public works programme (EPWPs), is clearly inadequate.4 It is this package, rather than the BIG that should be causing anxiety. If government were serious about reaching all of the poor with this package, especially the EPWP part of it, it would definitely not be affordable. Despite the failure so far, of government to [End Page 1] look seriously at the BIG numbers, the debate over those numbers, when it finally takes place, will at least revolve around familiar unknowns. Opponents and proponents alike will have to justify the claims they make, claims whose foundations will be laid bare for all to scrutinise. Not so the assertions made about (welfare) 'dependence'. Here we enter a terrain where values collide with murky 'facts'. It is this 'worry' with which the paper engages, attempting to separate 'fact' from 'value'. Although there is growing acceptance of the notion that evidence must be the basis of government policy, there are grounds for believing that as far as the BIG is concerned, neither the President nor the Minister of Finance has, as yet, applied his mind to the facts of the matter. Following the July 2003 lekgotla, President Mbeki is reported to have said that: We discussed BIG some time ago and we have said our approach should evolve through a comprehensive social system that includes old age pensions, disability grants and a free public health system. If you give everybody a R100 a month (sic) it will not make a difference. The notion that one single intervention will help is wrong. To introduce a system which indiscriminately gives R100 to a millionaire and a pensioner does not work. (Mail & Guardian, August 1-7, 2003:6) This extraordinary assertion is not inconsistent with other official pronouncements (or silence) on the matter. The Cabinet statement on the July 2003 lekgotla reproduced in ANC Today contains no reference at all to the BIG.5 The lekgotla confirmed the direction spelled out at the Growth and Development Summit (GDS), from whose agenda, BIG was excluded. In the passage cited above, the President manages, within the compass of a mere 70-odd words, to make five major errors. Here they are: 1. 'Evolving a comprehensive system'. A social system that excludes more than half of those suffering severe income poverty is NOT 'comprehensive'. It is a mistake to think that a partial substitute measure for social grants (public work programmes) can make the system 'comprehensive'. 2. 'R100 per month will not make a difference'. R100 per month would close about 70 per cent of the poverty gap, and would reach every poor person. No other social programme can achieve this.

Considered in its pure form, a basic in-come is paid (1) to individuals rather than households; (2) irrespective of wealth or any in-come from other sources; and (3) without requiring the performance of any work or the will-ingness to accept a job if offered. Its relevance to the problems of contemporary welfare states has long been recognized. From the 1970s onwards, forms of basic income have been regu-larly proposed for adapting the post-war institutions of social transfer to the conditions of a modern economy, in which lifetime security through earned income is no longer the norm. The guiding claim was that an unconditional floor of guaranteed income is justified as the fairest and the most efficient way of reconstructing basic security in the welfare state. Inevita-bly, the fairness part of this claim led to a principled debate concerning the unconditional features of basic income, in particular the absence of the requirement of willingness to work. The reason for this is obvious, for any moral justification of unconditional basic income has to deal with the objection that it is unfair to hand out transfers to able-bodied persons who are merely unwilling to earn a living. This theme has been explored in depth in Arguing for Basic Income (1992). This book is divided in two distinct but interrelated parts, both of which reflect the main topics of the 1998 Congress of the Basic Income European Network. The first part, Policy Objectives , analyzes the potential of basic income vis-A -vis other policy schemes to achieve the above-mentioned goals of welfare state reform. The second part, entitled Political Sup-port , reviews the state of the debate on basic income in various European countries.",,Basic income on the agenda: Introductory chapter,https://openalex.org/W3151120196

Having considered the main theoretical and methodological provisions of UBI, its advantages and disadvantages, having analysed country experiments on the introduction of UBI, interviewing experts and the population about the prospects for introducing UBI in Russia, having analysed the macroeconomic consequences based on an expert simulation dynamic model, the researchers answered affirmatively to the question posed “Universal basic income: a chance for Russia?” and believe that the transition to UBI in the country can be carried out gradually, through various transitional forms.&#x0D; First, the main arguments made in favour of introducing a UBI are false. The prediction that jobs will disappear in the future due to technological change is wildly exaggerated. There are doubts that UBI will be fair and can combat poverty and inequality. There is little reason to believe that a UBI is a better alternative to the current welfare system. Secondly, no one can accurately answer what the consequences of implementing UBI will be. Conclusions about its benefits are based on the results of country experiments and microsimulation modelling.

The article addresses the increasing significance for the process of valorisation today of digital ‘free labour’, and thus explores the idea that Universal Basic Income might have presented itself at this current juncture less to be a vehicle to a utopian future and more to be a handmaid for capitalism as its mode of production evolves. After utilising Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror to depict a dystopian imaginary of what a Universal Basic Income-future might thus really look like, the article concludes by questioning how we might rescue the scheme as a leftist project: attending to Guattari’s insights into how to resist capitalism’s subjectivation, as well as Fuchs’ vision for an ‘alternative Internet’.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0309816819852748,Universal basic income and cognitive capitalism: A post-work dystopia in the making?,https://openalex.org/W2950957636

Yet, the organisation of social protection within the European Union (EU) is insufficient to protect all Europeans effectively against the risk of poverty and social exclusion. Against this backdrop, this thesis investigates whether a European universal basic income (EUBI) is, if at all, a worthwhile policy to address the problem of poverty in the EU. 

The central claim of the study posits that there are strong reasons to consider a partial EUBI as a desirable instrument for EU-wide poverty alleviation. Under this scenario, the EU works as a complementary welfare layer offering systemic support to its Member States’ welfare models whilst respecting the diversity of national social protection arrangements. At the same time, as an instrument of pan-European solidarity, the EUBI provides substance to EU social citizenship. 

The method used is problem-oriented and interdisciplinary, combining insights from political theory, political economy and EU studies writ large. After having layed out the various dimensions underpinning the problem of poverty in the EU and clarified the contours of the solution under scrutiny, the thesis confronts the EUBI with a series of challenges, ranging from normative issues associated with the unconditionality of the basic income and the pursuit of social justice in the EU, to the institutional hurdles pertaining to the legal feasibility of the proposal, via the macroeconomic difficulties related to the diversity of interdependent economies. 

Overall, this contribution examines an idea which remains unexplored in EU studies and proposes a new approach to European anti-poverty strategy. It also bridges the gap between EU social policy and basic income literatures, beyond established boundaries of research compartmentalisation.

Critics of social assistance view dependency as an intrinsically negative state to be in, linked to “laziness” and oppression. They argue that basic income programs create dependency between the recipients of the programs and the provided service, and that this would reduce beneficiaries’ incentives to work. This paper contributes to the debate over the effectiveness of basic income programs by specifically analysing their impact on relationships of dependency. Throughout this analysis I will challenge the thesis that basic income fosters dependency by analysing two basic income pilots conducted in Madhya Pradesh, India. This paper finds that the fundamental assumptions underlying the concern that basic income fosters dependency in Madhya Pradesh are flawed. Relations of dependence are already present in the social fabric of rural India, and they are not intrinsically negative but instead represent ways through which people actively improve their position. Therefore, the question of basic income creating dependency is not the primary concern, and a more relevant policy question arises: how does the provision of basic income shape pre-existing relationships of dependency?

We find that CDEP suited the economic and cultural circumstances of remote-living Aboriginal people whose livelihoods depend on a hybrid form of economy inclusive of customary (non-market) practices rather than market capitalism. We then trace shifts in Indigenous policy in recent times which saw the dismantling of CDEP in the name of ‘real’ employment, and we examine the consequences of this for Aboriginal people.

In Sweden, public opinion is generally negative even in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it is barely discussed on the public policy table. On the other hand, in South Korea, public opinion is not as negative as in Sweden, and basic income is actively raised as policy agenda. Our study based on survey results reaffirmed the contrasting attitudes of the Swedish and Suth Korean people regarding basic income and related tax increase. The basic income could appeal to the people in South Korea. On the contrary, there is little room for the introduction of basic income in Sweden. The analysis also revealed similarities within the difference.

As a result, societies have implemented ‘cash transfer’ programmes, whichprovide income supplementation to reduce socioeconomic disadvantage among the poorest families with young children. Despite this being a common approach of societies around the world, research on effects of these programmes in low-income/middle-income countries, and those in high-income countries has been conducted as if they are entirely distinct phenomena. In this paper, we systematically review the international literature on the association between cash transfer programmes and health outcomes during the first year of life. Methods We conducted a systematic review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. Using a variety of relevant keywords, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Reviews, EconLit and Social Sciences Citations Index. Results Our review yielded 14 relevant studies. These studies suggested cash transfer programmes that were not attached to conditions tended to yield positive effects on outcomes such as birth weight and infant mortality. Programmes that were conditional on use of health services also carried positive effects, while those that carried labour-force participation conditionalities tended to yield no positive effects.

Discussions of the “goals of development” now often emphasize the reduction of poverty, rather than raising average incomes per se. The role of social services—particularly basic health and education—has also received greater emphasis in the 1980s, viewed mainly as instruments for raising the incomes of the poor. But, in all these approaches, income growth of one sort or another is what development is all about. A rather different view of the meaning of development has recently found expression in the 1990 Human Development Report (HRD) produced by the United Nations Development Programme. A conceptual underpinning for this approach can be found in the work of Amartya Sen. The essence of this view is that human development—what people can actually do and be—is the overriding purpose of economic development. Underdevelopment is viewed as the lack of certain basic capabilities, rather than lack of income per se. We do not aim here to advocate one of these approaches over the other, but rather to explore their implications for development policy. For instance, what does the human development approach imply about the role of economic growth and, in particular, about reducing income poverty? Should development priorities shift toward the provision of public services in poor countries, even if such a shift is at the expense of income growth?",https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.7.1.133,Human Development in Poor Countries: On the Role of Private Incomes and Public Services,https://openalex.org/W2086479170

The courts established that it had been his purpose to injure the plaintiffs by carrying off the water and to compel them to buy him off. Regardless of what the law says, most people will feel that the farmer's intentions were morally unjust; he was trying to abuse his property rights in order to take advantage of others. Yet, as Gijs van Donselaar explains, the major traditions in the theory of economic justice, both from the libertarian right and from the egalitarian left, have failed to appreciate the moral objection to exploitative behavior that this case displays. Those traditions entertain radically opposed views on how private property should be distributed, but they do not consider the legitimacy of constraints on the exercise of property rights-however they are distributed. The second part of the book demonstrates how this failure clears the way for a recent egalitarian argument, gaining in popularity, for a so-called unconditional basic income. If all have an initial right to an equal share of the resources of the world, then it soon seems to follow that all have a right to an equal share of the value of the resources of the world, which could be cashed in as a labor-free income. That inference is only valid if moral behavior similar to that of the farmer is tolerated. Van Donselaar argues that, ultimately, a confusion about the nature and value of freedom of choice is responsible for the odd conception of private rights in resources that would justify exploitation.

essential requisite to introduce a new stable compromise between capital and labour. Following the French Regulation School approach, we assert that the social compromise between capital and labour   is founded on the redistribution of the productivity gains. Therefore we try to trace living standards and social well being problems back to their origins, i.e.   the productivity growth. We think that describing the dynamics of productivity means understanding the main features of the contemporary capitalistic production. We first present a survey about BI in economic literature. We then focus on   the socio-economic transformation of western countries and propose the term   cognitive capitalism (CC) to describe the 
economic system after the Fordism paradigm crisis, highlighting the strong links between the exploitation of knowledge and the accumulation of surplus. Therefore   
we investigate the presence of a   new type of Kaldor-Verdoorn law in   cognitive capitalism (a virtuous circle among BI,   increasing productivity - via knowledge 
and network externalities - output and employment). As a result, we first point out the ambiguous growth circle of the contemporary capitalism. Secondly we highlight that BI is compatible with   the new way of accumulation, based on the exploitation of dynamic scale economies. BI increases productivity, through network (externalities) and learning processes and, at the same time, demand, via consumption level. This double result is not always guaranteed. It depends, on one side, on how much BI positively affects productivity, and the greater this probability, the lower the role played by intellectual property rights and the higher the diffusion of network economies (general intellect and social cooperation); on the other side, it depends on the way BI   is financed.

-35.608437,-9.551097,1,"Why 'personal' or 'private' accounts could save the system. Social security has been one of the most successful government programs in our nation's history. Unfortunately, the basic financial structure of Social security, designed during the depths of the Great Depression, is not well equipped to handle the substantial demographic changes that are under way in the United States. As a result, Social security simply cannot afford to pay currently scheduled benefits in the coming decades without imposing an ever-larger tax burden on younger workers. In the face of this demographic and financial reality, doing nothing is simply not a viable policy option. Social security must change if it is to be made financially secure. This article outlines the basic reasons that the Social security system is in long-run financial distress and discusses the policy options namely tax increases or benefit cuts-available for closing the financial shortfalls within the confines of the existing system. Pre-funding Social security-that is, saving more today in order to reduce the burden on future generations emerges as the most sensible way to proceed, with personal retirement accounts (PRAS) constituting a mechanism for saving that is superior to the current system's reliance on trust funds. Indeed, much of the current opposition to such accounts is based on misconceptions about PEAS as part of a reformed Social security system. A TAY As You GO' SYSTEM The U.S. Social security system is not a savings program. Rather, it is an income transfer system that taxes today's workers to pay benefits for today's retirees and other beneficiaries. Economists call such a financial structure a   or unfunded system. This is in sharp contrast to die pre-funded nature of most private-sector pension plans in which the money contributed to a worker's pension is invested in real financial assets (e.g., stocks or bonds) that are then used to pay benefits when the worker begins receiving benefits. In economic terms, the primary disadvantage of a   system relative to a pre-funded system is that it reduces national saving, reduces economic growth, and therefore shrinks the size of the economic pie (Feldstein, 1974). Despite its economic disadvantages, an unfunded, pay-as-you-go system can still work reasonably well when there are a large number of workers paying taxes to support each beneficiary. Back in 1950, for example, there were sixteen workers paying taxes to support each Social security beneficiary. At that time, a payroll tax rate of only 3 percent was sufficient to support the expenditures of the entire Social security program. As the Social security system has expanded and matured, however, the ratio of workers to retirees has fallen substantially, as indicated in Figure i. Today there are only 3.3 workers to support each beneficiary. As a result of population aging, this ratio will fall to just 2 within a generation.1 To put these numbers into perspective, consider the following example. When there are sixteen workers per retiree, as was the case in 1950, then for every $100 that the government pays to the average Social security beneficiary, each worker must pay a tax of $6.25. When the worker-to-beneficiary ratio falls to 3.3, as it stands today, each worker must pay over $30 in taxes to provide a $100 benefit. As this ratio falls to 2, the tax must rise to $50 per worker. Simple mathematics dictates that as the ratio of workers-to-beneficiaries declines, Social security must either raise taxes or reduce benefits in order to keep the system in annual fiscal balance. While this example is highly stylized, the lesson is very real. Today, employees and employers pay a combined 12.4 percent in Social Security taxes on die first $87,900 in earnings. These taxes, combined with a much smaller amount of revenue obtained from personal income taxation on some Social security benefits, raised approximately $470 billion in 2003. …",,The case for pre-funding social security,https://openalex.org/W267905602

40.496002,-5.0289035,2,"Proponents and opponents of a universal basic income all acknowledge that the most significant political challenge to its adoption in the United States is that a universal basic income would not have a work requirement attached. Often, this is characterized as a problem involving incentives—the availability of a universal basic income would cause many people to stop working (or significantly curtail the number of hours that they work) and simply live off the universal basic income. This Article makes three contributions to the literature related to a universal basic income: First, it provides a typology for understanding the many reasons for valuing work; second, it argues that the United States is unlikely to implement a universal basic income because a universal basic income does not account for several aspects of the value of work; and, third, it argues that advocates of a universal basic income should instead focus on the more modest goal of redefining the activities that constitute work and broadening the social safety net by expanding existing policies through the use of a broader definition of work. This Article proposes that the value of work in American political culture has four primary dimensions: 1) reciprocity, that one receives rewards for one’s labor, that one gets what one gives and that no one should be a free rider, one who gets but does not give; 2) calling or vocation, that work is a calling or vocation that one should have or pursue, and that only those that have or pursue such a calling or vocation have moral standing; 3) self sufficiency, that work promotes self sufficiency, which is a necessary component of liberty and which is necessary to avoid dependency; and 4) incentives, of an economic kind, that society should encourage work because it increases the size of the economic pie. These categories provide a new framework for thinking about the value of work and for evaluating policies that relate to the working lives of Americans. As an alternative to the adoption of a universal basic income, this Article proposes that proponents of a universal basic income should focus on expanding and redefining current policies, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit so that they more closely resemble a participation income. In fact, a broader definition of work has even been used in recent conservative policy ideas, such as the Medicaid work requirements that some states have introduced, which include within their definition of work the activities of education, job training, and community service. This Article closes with an outline of a proposal to adopt an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit that resembles a participation income and addresses each of the dimensions of the value of work.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3564492,Something for Nothing: Universal Basic Income and the Value of Work Beyond Incentives,https://openalex.org/W2999992206

It is also evaluated whether flat tax and UBI are effective measures of redistribution, as measured by the Gini index.

The Failed Welfare Revolution shows us that things might have turned out differently. During the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers in three presidential administrations tried to replace the nation's existing welfare system with a revolutionary program to guarantee Americans basic economic security. Surprisingly from today's vantage point, guaranteed income plans received broad bipartisan support in the 1960s. One proposal, President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan, nearly passed into law in the 1970s, and President Carter advanced a similar bill a few years later. The failure of these proposals marked the federal government's last direct effort to alleviate poverty among the least advantaged and, ironically, sowed the seeds of conservative welfare reform strategies under President Reagan and beyond.

Welfare reform rose to the top of the president's domestic policy agenda for a number of reasons, but the president selected the Family Assistance Plan (FAP) over more conservative alternatives in keeping with his political aims: the FAP would redistribute federal welfare to the white working poor in northern metropolitan areas, while simultaneously increasing federal welfare spending in southern states. As the 1970 midterm elections approached, however, the predominant political focus for the FAP became the effort to appeal to blue‐collar, northern white‐ethnic voters. In the aftermath of the disappointing results from those elections, President Nixon and his political team became convinced that a New Deal–style redistributive strategy was ineffective in appealing to conservative voters in the “silent majority,” especially southern conservatives who were opposed to any expansion of federal welfare, even when they would benefit directly. Instead, Nixon began to emphasize the FAP's value as a platform for launching strong rhetorical attacks on welfare. While the president subsequently pulled back from pushing for FAP's legislative enactment, offering an important explanation for the measure's failure, his antiwelfare rhetoric was politically successful, providing subsequent national conservative leaders with a political formula for utilizing antiwelfare rhetoric to build support among white working‐ and middle‐class voters.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2012.03989.x,Nixon's New Deal: Welfare Reform for the Silent Majority,https://openalex.org/W1934237607
20.662594,-1.4726018,5,"Is a basic income both affordable and desirable? The Covid-19 crisis promises to be as big a shock to the UK economy as the 2007-08 financial crisis. The Office for Budget Responsibility recently published a scenario of the likely economic impact of the coronavirus shock to the economy. Making a number of assumptions, it suggested that real national income would fall by about a third in the second quarter of 2020. Public sector net borrowing would rise to about 14 per cent of national income, and this would be the highest annual deficit since the second world war.1 One idea for relieving the economic effects of the crisis is to implement a universal basic income. A basic income promises: ‘regular, non-means-tested cash transfers to all residents of a political territory on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement’.2 A universal basic income has five key parts, namely, that it: is regular; is paid in cash; is provided to the individual; is universal with no means test; and is unconditional with no requirement to work or seek work.3 Long-standing supporters of a basic income, such as Guy Standing, call for this policy to help people cope with the economic fallout of the global pandemic.4 This piece considers whether Covid-19 affects two key objections to a universal basic income among the left: adequacy and opportunity cost. “A full universal basic income has yet to be implemented in the world. Much existing evidence draws from pilots of partial basic income schemes in places such as Finland, as well as policy simulations” A second objection is that there are alternative policies that are better for relieving poverty. Indeed, critics claim that a universal basic income distracts time and resources from pursuing these other policies. Piachaud summarises this view: “What is perhaps most frustrating for those who see little attraction in pursuing a basic income is that, while it is part of a spectrum of social protection and social security measures, giving it pre-eminence diverts from the task of promoting more feasible and sensible reforms. There is a desperate need for more investment in human capital for the least advantaged and for more equal opportunities for all.”9 A range of arguments might be advanced both for and against the various claims that Piachaud makes in the above quotation (for example, the attention paid to investment in human capital for the least advantaged over a universal basic income). This piece does not delve into those arguments here as the focus is on the impact that Covid-19 has on a universal basic income. But the above quotation helps place the arguments about a universal basic income and Covid-19 within a broader context and set of debates. The global pandemic has already prompted some sceptics to rethink their views on a universal basic income.10 Covid-19 presents the need for rapid and immediate relief. It may be very complex to devise rapid and targeted help, and so universal income payments have the virtue of simplicity. This has been taken on board in the government response. For example, the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme provides a taxable grant to employers for furloughed employees worth 80 per cent of the employee's wage cost (up to £2,500 a month).11 A similar package of support is also provided to the self-employed. In the US, President Donald Trump signed an act promising $2 trillion of federal government help to households and businesses. Among the measures enacted are a set of economic impact payments that amount to $1,200 per person for one year and up to $500 for each child under 16 years of age.12 “Research suggests that the low-paid are among those hit worst by the coronavirus lockdown” Research suggests that the low-paid are among those hit worst by the coronavirus lockdown. One-third of employees in the bottom tenth of the earnings distribution work in sectors that are shut down, compared with 5 per cent of those in top tenth of the earnings distribution. Furthermore, women are more badly affected than men, with 17 per cent of female employees working in sectors that are shut down compared to 13 per cent of male employees.13 Many households are facing falls in income, but poorer households are less able to cope with drops in income because a larger part of their household budget is spent on essential items than richer households. On average, the poorest fifth of households spend around 55 per cent of their budgets on essential items, while the richest fifth spent around 39 per cent. This pattern is reversed for items that have been affected by social distancing measures such as travel, leisure or eating out.14 Clearly, poorer households are in greater need of help than richer ones in coping with Covid-19. This suggests that targeted income support may be the priority rather than universal income payments. “Government spending here arose from a very specific set of conditions that, one hopes, are unlikely to be repeated for some time” One might counter, though, that it is very difficult to draw general lessons from the exceptional nature of Covid-19. Government spending here arose from a very specific set of conditions that, one hopes, are unlikely to be repeated for some time. The 2007-08 financial crisis ushered in a decade of austerity. A Conservative government charged with dealing with the aftermath of Covid-19 might make similar fiscal choices, and this is without taking account on the pressures on public finances from Brexit. This alternative view offers a gloomier reading about the affordability of a universal basic income. While it is true that the bounds of government spending may be greater than often is presented in policy debates, it is unclear whether the Covid-19 crisis will seriously weaken the view that an adequate universal basic income is unaffordable. Again, it is likely that the best prospect is for a time limited scheme of emergency payments rather than a permanent income stream. The second objection to a universal basic income asks whether there are better alternatives for relieving poverty. One such alternative is universal basic services. The pandemic has made clear which services are deemed to be essential in a modern economy. The UK government published a list of key workers who are allowed to travel to their normal place of work during the crisis. These included those working in health services; transport; food supply; the police; and those working in utilities such as electricity, gas or water.16 These key worker sectors overlap considerably with calls for a welfare state built around universal basic services.17 There are seven core services in the model of universal basic services, namely: health care; education; shelter; food; transport; legal and democracy; and information. The aim is for these services to be publicly funded and be free at the point of delivery. Some services are familiar and are already provided in the welfare state such as the National Health Service. Other services are more novel. For example, an information service would provide free basic phone and internet access to all citizens. This proposal overlaps with the promise made in Labour's 2019 general election manifesto to provide free broadband for all,18 a pledge which was derided at the time in much of the media and public discussions. (Arguably, one failing of the manifesto was that it did not embed the broadband idea in a supporting policy approach such as universal basic services). “some aspects of a universal basic services approach are probably a greater priority at the moment than a universal basic income. But there is also a case for emergency income payments to help people and households cope with the immediate economic shocks from Covid-19” Schools were closed prior to the official lockdown. The education of schoolchildren depends largely upon them being able to access online lessons or homework from school. Evidence from Lloyds Bank Consumer Digital Index reports that in 2018, 700,000 11 to 18 year olds (12 per cent) have no internet access at home through a computer or tablet.20 Similarly, in the official lockdown period, employees who could work from home were instructed to do so. But the capacity to work also depends on access to the internet. And for the retired who are staying at home, the internet is a way for them to maintain social contacts. For these reasons, some aspects of a universal basic services approach are probably a greater priority at the moment than a universal basic income. But there is also a case for emergency income payments to help people and households cope with the immediate economic shocks from Covid-19. The questions of the best mix of universal basic services and emergency income payments to react to the crisis remains open. Covid-19 has caused a major shock to the economy. As politicians and policymakers grapple with its challenges, one initial response has been to refuel calls for a universal basic income. This piece suggests that, despite the flurry of interest, Covid-19 is unlikely to change the core arguments over a universal basic income. At best, the coronavirus makes a case for temporary emergency income payments. Turning these temporary payments into permanent ones requires engaging with the more usual arguments over a basic income heard in more usual times. Questions remain about the best mix of universal basic services and emergency income payments for reacting to the crisis, with one priority now being to address a digital divide.

This article uses evidence from the fifth sweep of the National Child Development Study to analyse the use of childcare by a cohort of employed women who were aged 33 in 1991. There is a heavy reliance on informal care by women in partnerships and also by lone mothers. Formal care is most heavily used by women whose youngest child is under five, especially if the woman works full-time. Reported costs of childcare represent nearly a quarter of net weekly earnings for mothers with a child under five. Formal childcare is shown to play an important role in facilitating women's full-time employment. Full-time employment is the route by which women achieve financial independence from their partner. It also increases the likelihood of contributing to an occupational pension which, in turn, has implications for financial independence in later life. However, the majority of women in this cohort do not take the full-time route. For these women, low earnings potential and part-time working make paid childcare uneconomic and reinforces both their role as minor financial contributors within the family and their lack of pension provision in later life.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0047279400000325,Combining Employment with Childcare: An Escape From Dependence?,https://openalex.org/W2133448432

Previous research has shown that public support is volatile and contingent on the definition of UBI. Two key determinants were also identified: individual and contextual factors.

In this chapter, we take a comprehensive approach by providing a brief overview of the state of knowledge on public support for a UBI.

Whether they actually have such an incredible impact on poverty reduction is debatable but they surely are gaining credibility as an effective safety net mechanism and consequently an integral part of inclusive growth strategies in many developing countries. As shown by Ali (2007), inclusive growth rests on three basic premises. First, productive employment opportunities should be created to absorb labour force. Second, capability enhancement and skill development should be focused in order to broaden people’s access to economic opportunities. And lastly, a basic level of well-being has to be guaranteed by providing social protection. Safety nets are at the core of the last pillar, provided mainly through cash transfers, which can be both conditional and unconditional. The basic rationale behind the social safety nets is to assist the poor to better manage risk and help them to adopt a strategy that protects their assets. The importance of these safety nets has been recognised not only for their social and economic value but also as a means to improve political stability and control crime and riots. These safety nets help people through short-term stress and insecurities, which if properly managed can lead to long-term poverty alleviation as well. Direct transfers by the government are a common means of providing safety net to the poor. Such transfers include direct provision of food or cash (conditional or unconditional) to the target population. Other means of providing safety nets include: education and health subsidies; energy, water and housing subsidies; and public works programmes. It is worth mentioning here that, although usually used interchangeably, there is a need to differentiate between the term social protection and social safety nets [Bari, et al. (2005); Sayeed (2004)]. Conceptually, analytically and by implications, social protection is a right that every citizen must have while safety nets are instruments employed to provide these rights. 1",,Effectiveness of Cash Transfer Programmes for Household Welfare in Pakistan: The Case of the Benazir Income Support Programme,https://openalex.org/W3149523228

Given the poverty reduction targets passed by the B.C. government, detailed in Petit and Tedds (2020d), the potential impacts include those on the incidence and the depths of poverty in the province (B.C.

The panel ran over 16,000 different BI scenarios to consider in B.C., which were modelled using Statistics Canada’s Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M) program. We evaluate different BI scenarios in terms of their implications for a variety of measures, including cost, number of recipients, rates of poverty, depths of poverty, distributional affects, and inequality impacts. This paper provides details regarding these simulations.

Widows, with some restrictions, were entitled to outdoor relief under the Poor Law Amendment Act (1834), and they comprised the largest group of adult paupers outside of the workhouse well into the early twentieth century, outnumbered only and always by their children. Able-bodied widows therefore presented crucial opportunities for poor law officials in the quest to minimise outdoor relief and make significant reductions in welfare spending. Focusing particularly on the 1830s, 1840s, and 1870s (the first decade of the so-called crusade against out-relief), this article examines the competing discourses of deservingness and deception that dominated the representations and treatment of able-bodied widows in poor law legislation, orders, reports, and parliamentary debates. An uneasy combination of sympathy and suspicion shaped officials' treatment of these women, rendering them ambiguous figures in the dominant dichotomy of the deserving and undeserving poor, potential drains on the economic prosperity of the state, threats to the nuclear family, and, by extension, a danger to the nation's moral core.

Considering that nearly every system of taxation either makes some provision for differences in family size and composition or has provisions that have varying welfare implications depending on such differences, the apparent lack of attention in the theoretical literature to the implications of endogenous fertility is surprising. Tax and family policies designed to affect the distribution of income or welfare that do not take into account their effects on fertility may have unintended consequences. For example, if poverty, in the sense of low family income per capita, tends to be associated with large family size, a system of child allowances and tax exemptions designed to alleviate poverty and reduce inequality may actually worsen the situation. The chapter presents an assumption that preferences are given and homogenous. However, there are differences in exogenous opportunities such as innate abilities that induce differences in income or welfare, and as fertility is endogenous, such differences in opportunities also induce differences in family size.",https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-515752-0.50014-0,Intragenerational Income Distribution Policies,https://openalex.org/W198056217

The importance of upstream health determinants suggests that basic income could improve health and reduce health inequalities. Since the effects of a universal, permanent basic income would differ from those of a trial, extrapolation of impacts from existing evidence is difficult. However, studies of interventions that unconditionally provide substantial, regular payments to individuals or families can provide insights into the potential effects. We conducted a scoping review to identify and synthesise evidence that could inform the planning stage of potential basic income pilots in Scotland. Methods We searched eight bibliographic and eight specialist databases for articles published in English from database inception until April, 2017 (initial searches), and November, 2017 (later iteration). We included randomised controlled trials, quasi-experiments, qualitative studies, and controlled before–after studies reporting any outcome of unconditional payments for low-income people or the general population. Studies conducted in low-income countries were excluded. Initial searches indicated that there were important studies of other interventions, so relevant search terms were incorporated in further iterative searches. Results were screened by one reviewer and a second reviewer checked a 10% sample. Data were charted and thematically analysed, following recognised scoping review approaches. Findings From 1591 papers identified, we included 28 studies of ten interventions implemented in a range of contexts that used various evaluation methods. The interventions were heterogeneous, but some were universal and permanent, and all provided substantial, regular payments unconditionally. Studies measured effects on employment, health, education, crime, and other social outcomes. Evidence on health impacts was mixed, with some studies finding strong positive impacts on outcomes such as birthweight and mental health, whereas others reported no effect. There was some evidence that effects were stronger in more at-risk groups. Most studies reported little impact on labour market participation. Interpretation Fears of a large decrease in labour market participation due to basic income seem to be unfounded, but inference was often hampered by small samples or multiple intervention arms. Further small-scale pilots would be of limited usefulness.

Second, the transition to basic income must be designed as a generation-spanning process in which no age and income groups feel as losers.

The analysis of scientific papers highlighted the problem of the lack of empirical studies that allow assessing the attitude to the introduction of unconditional basic income of the population as an object of social protection practices and professionals in the field of social protection as a subject introducing new tools in this area. In 2021–2022, the authors conducted an intelligence sociological study based on a questionnaire survey of 400 respondents living in various territories of the Irkutsk region, and 32 semi-structured interviews among managers and specialists in the field of social protection of the population of the Irkutsk region and the Republic of Buryatia. The focus of the analysis is focused on comparing the assessments and opinions of objects and subjects of social protection practices.

There is a generally low level of awareness of both categories of respondents regarding the studied mechanism of social protection.

I answer this question with a quantitative model to assess the general equilibrium, inequality, and welfare effects of substituting the current US income security system with a universal basic income (UBI) policy. To do so, I develop an overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic income risk that incorporates intensive and extensive margins of the labor supply, on-the-job learning, and child-bearing costs. The tax-transfer system closely mimics the US design. I calibrate the model to the US economy and conduct counterfactual analyses that implement reforms toward a UBI. I find that an expenditure-neutral reform has moderate impacts on agents’ labor supply response but induces aggregate capital and output to grow due to larger precautionary savings. A UBI of $1,000 monthly requires a substantial increase in the tax rate of consumption used to clear the government budget and leads to an overall decrease in the macroeconomic aggregates, stemming from a drop in the labor supply. In both cases, the economy has more equally distributed disposable income and consumption.

We then consider approaches to calculating cost in a UK context to estimate budgetary burdens that need to be met by the state.

However, by the end of the twentieth century, as a result of the changing family reforms and labour market patterns, leave arrangements had become a major policy issue with debates concentrating on entitlement, length of leave, and income support. This chapter discusses the development of leave policies, specifically parental leave in the Netherlands. This development has involved different interpretations of the purpose of leave and the divisions of responsibilities between the government, parents, and social partners. Starting from the view point in which parental leave was seen as a way to facilitate part-time employment, the Parental Leave Act provided a basic entitlement to take part-time, unpaid leave for a short period of time. It was left to the social partners to supplement this minimum. However, over time, public responsibility for leave has increased. This was evident not only in the increasing number of leave policies, but in the growing public involvement in the provision of income support as well. During this process, the interpretation of parental leave appeared to have changed from a labour market instrument into a more complex instrument intended to facilitate parenthood and the well-being of children.",https://doi.org/10.56687/9781847427779-014,The Netherlands: bridging labour and care,https://openalex.org/W4383811054

The various policies in the egalitarian toolkit, however, have implications for issues other than contributing to a more just economic system. In particular, they have implications for the long term stability, transformation, or even transcendence, of capitalism as an economic system. In this article I will argue that unconditional Basic Income has a greater potential to erode capitalism than does Basic Capital. While both of these policies in the egalitarian toolkit may make the economic system statically more just, over time Basic Capital grants are likely to strengthen capitalism as the core structure of the economic system, whereas unconditional Basic Income has the potential to erode the dominance of capitalism.

More recently, this approach has spread beyond high-income economies, and is prominent today in many middle-income economies. Yet, despite the increasing adoption of integrated approaches, their conceptual and practical applications have not been studied in detail outside of high-income countries. This paper conceptualizes, for the first time, the implementation of integrated approaches, focusing on low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We first develop a conceptual framework to understand how integrated policies can address labour market challenges, exploring the theoretical effects they exert on selected labour market and social dimensions. We then contrast these theoretical expectations with findings from the empirical literature on the effectiveness of integrated approaches. While many empirical studies find positive effects across different labour market dimensions, this is evidently not always the case. To reconcile this discrepancy, we investigate the design and implementation of integrated approaches across LMIC and identify factors which contribute to their effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.54394/lrss5070,Why should we integrate income and employment support?,https://openalex.org/W4288082122

Early automation, the decline of labor unions, changes in corporate taxation, the financialization and globalization of the economy, deindustrialization in the U.S. and many OECD countries, and trade have contributed to these trends. However, the transformative roles of more recent automation and digital technologies/artificial intelligence (AI) are now considered by many as additional and potentially more potent forces undermining the ability of workers to maintain their foothold in the economy. These drivers of change are intensifying the extent to which advancing technology imbedded in increasingly productive real capital is driving productivity. To compound the problem, many solutions presented by industrialized nations to environmental problems rely on hyper-efficient technologies, which if fully implemented, could further advance the displacement of well-paid job opportunities for many. While there are numerous ways to address economic inequality, there is growing interest in using some form of universal basic income (UBI) to enhance income and provide economic stability. However, these approaches rarely consider the potential environmental impact from the likely increase in aggregate demand for goods and services or consider ways to focus this demand on more sustainable forms of consumption. Based on the premise that the problems of income distribution and environmental sustainability must be addressed in an integrated and holistic way, this paper considers how a range of approaches to financing a UBI system, and a complementary market solution based on an ownership-broadening approach to inclusive capitalism, might advance or undermine strategies to improve environmental sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su11164481,Universal Basic Income and Inclusive Capitalism: Consequences for Sustainability,https://openalex.org/W2968037914

In a time when individuals prefer to operate as autonomous individuals, being
dependent is often thought of as a negative state that is best overcome as soon as
possible (Lee, 2002; Stone, 2010). Political institutions have a similar view when
it comes to reliance on welfare services: welfare state services should support
people for as short as possible so as to ensure that they are able to carry on living
independently (Gilbert, 2004).
Whereas the insistence on independence from welfare support has been present
in US welfare politics from its beginning, it is relatively new in European welfare
states such as The Netherlands (Hemerijck, 2013). European welfare systems used
to be passive systems aimed at income maintenance but have transformed into
activating systems aimed at maximizing labor market employment by stressing
individual responsibility (Gilbert, 2004), and the Dutch welfare system forms no
exception to this rule (Hemerijck & Marx, 2010).
Due to the imminent unsustainability of generous social protection programs
given aging populations, European welfare states have been retrenching (Pavolini
& Ranci, 2008; Pierson, 2011). For many welfare states, this is a continuation of
the transformation of welfare states into activating systems.

For this reason, they cannot adequately explain the dynamics of an important, but frequently overlooked, episode in American welfare state history: the rise and fall of guaranteed annual income proposals in the 1960s and 1970s. The author outlines three mechanisms—schematic, discursive, and institutional—through which culture can influence policy outcomes. He then argues that cultural categories of worthiness affected welfare policy development through their constitutive contribution to cultural schemas, their deployment by actors as resources in expert deliberation and public discourse, and their institutionalization in social programs that reinforced the symbolic and programmatic boundaries between categories of the poor.

While Piketty deems Marx’s theory overly simplistic, Piketty’s contention that modern democratic nation-states should confront the problem of increasing economic inequality exaggerates governments’ ability to regulate the economy today. Basic income is indicative both of the diminished capacity of states to promote social welfare via established policy strategies, and the heightened need to scrutinize the specific logic of capital in the twenty-first century.

In the wake of these events, welfare rolls have shrunk dramatically and employment among the poor has increased, leading many to conclude that these policies have achieved important equity and efficiency goals. It is argued here that these conclusions are too strong. The work requirements and time limits of welfare reform create equity outcomes that are dubious and leave the potential for inefficiencies in the allocation of labor. The EITC excludes almost half of the poor population under age 65, rewards poorer working families less well than it does less poor working families, and provides a sizable work disincentive for a large proportion of its recipients. It is shown here that the poor are not homogeneous. Specifically, the very poor have a much higher incidence of physical and other disabilities. The ability to work varies substantially with income among the poor. There is a case to be made for a much more straightforward form of redistribution, such as the Basic Income Guarantee (BIG). It is quite possible that a BIG would accomplish goals of equity and efficiency more fully than the current mosaic of redistributive programs.

This is the reason that both left and right parties have recently agreed on the necessity of universal basic income. The basic income system, different from the current welfare system, is the minimum social welfare system which provides the whole citizen with the income without any responsibilities and the condition. This study has researched the feasibility of the universal basic income by taking the case of the Republic of France. As a result of the analysis of four scenarios of basic income system, private-public basic income experiment, and ongoing discourses, the universal basic income can be boosted only when the clear establishment of concept, the standardized model, and extensive experiments are preceded. Besides, the French basic income system is not a new one but the experiments have been conducted in addition to the existing welfare reformation. The creation of RMI in 1989, and RSA in 2009 are those examples. The realization of French universal basic income is at the last stage of completing the welfare system but this is not an easy journey. The implication of French universal basic income movement gives us is that we need to first of all extend the welfare system as well as continuously develop the policies applying the concept of basic income. It is a big adventure to adopt the universal basic income at a current stage, when we have a weak welfare system.

Two popular approaches to empirical optimal taxation are the structural analytical approach and the non-tructural “sufficient statistics” approach. This paper presents a different approach that combines structural microeconometric modelling, behavioural microsimulation and numerical optimization. For each country, we estimate a microeconometric model of labour supply for both couples and singles. A procedure that simulates the households' choices under given tax-transfer rules is then embedded in a constrained optimization program in order to identify optimal rules under the public budget constraint. The optimality criterion is the class of Kolm's social welfare function. The tax-transfer rules considered as candidates are members of a class that includes as special cases various versions of the Negative Income Tax: Conditional (means-tested) Basic Income, Unconditional Basic Income, In-Work Benefits and General Negative Income Tax, combined with a Flat Tax above the exemption level. The analysis in most cases show that: the General Negative Income Tax strictly dominates the other rules, including the current ones; the Unconditional Basic Income policy is better than the Conditional Basic Income policy; Conditional Basic Income policy may lead to a significant reduction in labour supply and poverty-trap effects; In-Work-Benefit policy is strictly dominated by the General Negative Income Tax and by the Unconditional Basic Income.

These random-control trial designs study the effects on employment, social participation, health and well-being of exempting social assistance claimants from the duties of seeking work and participating in training activities under the workfare-oriented Participation Act. In some treatment groups, claimants also retain a larger percentage of earnings, thereby reducing the poverty trap. These two design features resemble an unconditional basic income. I situate the experiments in the wider context of basic income and discuss their theoretical background and policy orientation. Under existing legal strictures, the experimental designs are too limited to judge the effects of replacing the conditional scheme of social assistance by an unconditional one.

Growth takes place in terms of monetary flows, financial assets and transactions, capital accumulation; in terms of aggregate material throughput, infrastructure, desires, efficiency and productivity. It is equally promoted by those who call for austerity as well as those who advocate Keynesianism. The final result is often the same. Problems are shifted in space and time. The growth fetish, however, will not go away by ignoring it, but by creating the necessary political, social and economic conditions for managing and living well without growth. Degrowth, unlike what the term may suggest to the uninitiated, is not a technical economic term, meaning the opposite of growth. While it denounces GDP growth, its focus lies on changing the context and the units of measurement, or reference. The thorny goal of reducing consumption within degrowth is driven by principles of political organization in the spirit of caring for the commons, voluntary simplicity, and conviviality. Our hypothesis is that there is little to lose from embarking on a degrowth trajectory. On the contrary, only by dropping the growth fetish (now) can emissions be stabilized and extreme events prevented from menacing livelihoods. We empirically demonstrate here that the discomforts associated with living in a state of climatic instability cannot be offset by monetary growth.

The actual or net burden is less than one third of the gross cost of the payments made, i.e. about R15 billion rather than R52 billion. The net impact remains progressive, with the affluent progressively paying more and the poor progressively benefiting more. Financing a universal grant through what is effectively an expenditure tax increase is far less likely to distort the economy than increases in income taxes or company taxes. The proposal also avoids the problem of poverty traps. Paying the grant to individuals (except for children, whose grants are paid to the care‐giver) and making the net benefit or burden of the proposed grant dependent on individual expenditure rather than on family or household income, means that largest benefits are targeted on those household members (typically women and children) who receive small proportions of family income.

The disagreement among business groups comes down to either (1) a basic misunderstanding of proposal details, or (2) the fact that the policy itself can take on a wide range of concrete forms. To the extent that business has exhibited support for guaranteed income policies, the actual policies in question tended to be “two-tiered” rather than unitary, selective rather than universal, and miserly rather than generous. The income maintenance policies that garnered some support among business groups would all include explicit or implicit work requirements for “able-bodied” adults. By contrast, generous, unconditional guaranteed income policies that reduce workers’ market dependence—namely, those that basic income advocates find desirable—found no audience in business circles.

Such a system is cheap and easy to administer as there is no means testing or checks on conditionality. There are a growing number of trials across the world and increasing support for such a scheme in the UK. A decade of austerity policies in the UK followed by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the views of some that UBI would not only address the issue of poverty and low-paid work but would serve as a response to growing automation in the workplace. It might also increase the bargaining power of workers who would be less worried about losing their job if they had the cushion of UBI.,https://doi.org/10.13169/jglobfaul.9.2.0225,Universal basic income: An idea whose time has come or just another mechanism to grease the wheels of capitalism?,https://openalex.org/W4320734633
-19.882816,-2.1014678,5,"This paper aims at proposing a first theoretical framework for studying the basic income sustainability. We consider the basic income not only as a tool of a policy to improve living standards and social well-being but, mostly, as the essential requisite to introduce a new stable compromise between capital and labour. Following the French Regulation School approach, we assert that the social compromise between capital and labour is founded on the redistribution of the productivity gains. Therefore we try to trace living standards and social well being problems back to their origins, i.e. the productivity growth. We think that describing the dynamics of productivity means understanding the main features of the contemporary capitalistic production. We first present a survey about BI in economic literature. We then focus on the socio-economic transformation of western countries and propose the term cognitive capitalism (CC) to describe the economic system after the Fordism paradigm crisis, highlighting the strong links between the exploitation of knowledge and the accumulation of surplus. Therefore we investigate the presence of a new type of Kaldor-Verdoorn law in cognitive capitalism (a virtuous circle among BI, increasing productivity - via knowledge and network externalities - output and employment). As a result, we first point out the ambiguous growth circle of the contemporary capitalism. Secondly we highlight that BI is compatible with the new way of accumulation, based on the exploitation of dynamic scale economies. BI increases productivity, through network (externalities) and learning processes and, at the same time, demand, via consumption level. This double result is not always guaranteed. It depends, on one side, on how much BI positively affects productivity, and the greater this probability, the lower the role played by intellectual property rights and the higher the diffusion of network economies (general intellect and social cooperation); on the other side, it depends on the way BI is financed. These results also depend on the assumption of closed economy, in which financial markets play no role at all.",,Basic income sustainability and productivity growth in cognitive capitalism: a first theoretical framework,https://openalex.org/W3147001010

Obviously, there is some link between these two faults: since most people living in capitalist economies must work for wages as a major source of their incomes, the inability to obtain a job means a lower income. If jobs can be provided to the unemployed, inequality and poverty will be reduced--although such policy will not directly address the problem of excessive income at the top of the distribution. Most importantly, Keynes wanted to put unemployed labor to work--not digging holes, but in socially productive ways. This would help to ensure that the additional effective demand created by government spending would not be exhausted in higher prices as it ran up against bottlenecks or other supply constraints. Further, it would help maintain public support for the government's programs by providing useful output. And it would generate respect for, and feelings of self-worth in, the workers employed in these projects (no worker would want to spend her days digging holes that serve no useful purpose). President Roosevelt's New Deal jobs programs (such as the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps) are good examples of such targeted job-creating programs. These provided income and employment for workers, actually helped increase the nation's productivity, and left us with public buildings, dams, trails, and even music that we still enjoy today.

Despite their simplicity and initial appeal, in this paper I argue that we should reject such procedural accounts. After giving the best case for procedural arbitrariness and defending it against an intuitive objection, I proceed by examining a set of problem cases, examples of what Erving Goffman called 'total institutions' – highly rule-bound, tightly controlled environments. Although it is possible for these institutions to be non-arbitrary in the procedural sense, I argue that we should nevertheless see them as prime examples of domination. Such environments produce a relevantly similar bundle of psychological effects – anxiety, adaptation, and so on – to other paradigm cases of domination.

The objective of the study was to analyze strengths, opportunities as well as weaknesses and threats that are connected with UBI. The main possible advantages of UBI revealed in the paper are as follows: poverty reduction; possibility to lead a decent life, no matter what happens; insurance against financial disasters in light of the threat of a decline in employment due to the growing automation of processes; possibility for people to spend more time with their families or volunteer activities; reduction of corruption opportunities. The most serious drawbacks of UBI identified in the paper are as follows: burden on public finances; possible tax increases; reduction of other social programs, fraught with public discontent; dismantling of labor and socially useful activities; polarization of society; loss of skills and the inability to return to the labor market.

48.019604,-30.190805,3,"ABSTRACTThis paper develops a Polanyian capabilitarian framework to understand and justify the universal basic income. I combine Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach with Karl Polanyi’s substantive view of economy to mount a normative case for basic income. Using this approach, I also ground the basic income debate in a relational ontology, the idea that the self and society are mutually constituted. By doing so, I problematise hegemonic assumptions underlying much of the basic income discourse and call for ontological and epistemic diversity. The paper both provides a critique of individualist ontology and offers an affirmative modification centred on relationality and interdependence.KEYWORDS: Universal basic incomeAmartya SenKarl Polanyicapabilities approachembeddednessrelational ontology AcknowledgementsThis is a revised version of the paper presented on the 30th of September 2022 at the German Historical institute workshop “Beyond Work for Pay? Basic-Income Concepts in Global Debates on Automation, Poverty, and Unemployment (1920–2020)” in Washington, DC. I thank the organisers and participants for their insightful comments and feedback. I also thank two anonymous reviewers for the generous comments that helped refine my argument.Disclosure StatementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 The normative literature on UBI is vast, the taxonomies are many, and the history of arguments is rich. Widerquist et al. (Citation2013) map out usefully the right-libertarian, left-libertarian, social egalitarian, republican, Marxist, communitarian, feminist, and post-productivist approaches. A comprehensive overview is also given by Bidadanure (Citation2019), Gentilini et al. (Citation2020), and Henderson (Citation2017), among others.2 This resonates with Anderson’s (Citation2000) argument that we need to focus on concrete freedoms that allow people to avoid oppression; hence universal basic income must be part of larger justification, ethically, and part of welfare package, politically.3 Lain (Citation2018) insists that there are shared affinities between the republican tradition and Karl Polanyi’s political economy (see the following sections on Polanyi). However, while he argues that both traditions share epistemological and methodological assumptions, the intersubjective character of Polanyi’s ontology is glossed over. I thank Bru Lain for highlighting the links between republicanism and Polanyi’s work during our personal communication.4 On intersubjective ontology of Amartya Sen, see also Yamamori (Citation2018).5 This call has been also voiced by scholars of post-development (Escobar Citation1995; Ferguson Citation1990; Teo Citation2010) and coloniality critique (Escobar Citation2018; Quijano Citation2000; Spivak Citation1988). To simplify, the former camp highlights how mainstream development theory and practice overlook diverse ontologies of the “non-developed” world; objectify those who need development; and produce “epistemological violence” through unequal relations of power. The latter group interrogates the Western hegemonic rationalities embedded in prescriptions from the Global North, pointing to the diversity of worldviews and indigenous systems of knowledge.6 To be sure, political theorists have developed capabilitarian approaches to universal basic income as, for instance, in Widerquist (Citation2013). In contrast and by extension, I shall approach the basic income debate from a combined Polanyian capabilitarian perspective.7 As Charles Taylor reminds us: “Taking an ontological position does not amount to advocating something; but at the same time, the ontological does help to define the options which it is meaningful to support by advocacy” (Taylor Citation1989, 161).8 This overlaps with the Aristotelian tradition of “flourishing,” as highlighted by Sayer (Citation2011), for instance. For example, if someone lacks proper nourishment or shelter (capabilities), she is not able to achieve several functionings, such as a decent lifestyle or engagement with a community. Capability deprivation prevents human flourishing.9 I follow Andrew Milner in defining utilitarianism as “a view of the social world as consisting, ideally or factually, in a plurality of discrete, separate, rational individuals, each of whom is motivated, to all intents and purposes exclusively, by the pursuit of pleasure (or utility) and the avoidance of pain” (Milner Citation1994, 8). As a system of ethics underpinned by the principle of “the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people,” utilitarianism was developed in the mid-nineteenth century by the modern liberal philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Utilitarianism underlies many of the mainstream economics” assumptions and has been commonly linked to capitalism as its hegemonic culture.10 Political philosopher Martha Nussbaum developed a list of ten allegedly universal human capabilities (Nussbaum Citation2011), although Sen insisted that capabilities are necessarily context-specific. On Nussbaum’s account, the central capabilities for leading a decent life are: life quality; bodily health; bodily integrity; senses, imagination and thought; emotions; practical reason; affiliation with others; living with other species; play; and control over one’s environment.11 In The Great Transformation, Polanyi notes that Aristotle “had taught that only gods or beasts could live outside society, and man was neither” (Polanyi, Citation2001, p. 119). On connections between Polanyi and Aristotle, see also Sayer (Citation2011) and, most recently, Gemici (Citation2023).12 Robeyns (Citation2017, 55–57) highlights two meanings of value pluralism: the “multidimensional nature of the capability approach” outlined above and “principle pluralism” that considers values beyond expansion of capabilities and functionings. See the following sections on the latter.13 See later on the distinction between ethical, or normative, and ontological individualism.14 This perspective dovetails with the human rights approach codified, most notably, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) – adopted four years after publication of The Great Transformation – and the subsequent International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). I thank an anonymous reviewer for highlighting this point. In human rights terms, the universal access to an adequate standard of living, a right to work and social protection, and freedom from want, for instance, resemble the language of capabilities and functionings. See Langford (Citation2005) for the distinction between commodity, public, community, and human rights approaches. For the discussion of the relationship between capabilities theories and human rights accounts, see Robeyns (Citation2017, 161–168).15 Amartya Sen clearly acknowledged that humans are socially embedded: “It is essentially a “people-centered” approach, which puts human agency (rather than organizations such as markets or governments) at the centre of the stage. The crucial role of social opportunities is to expand the realm of human agency and freedom, both as an end in itself and as a means of further expansion of freedom. The word “social” in the expression “social opportunity” […] is a useful reminder not to view individuals and their opportunities in isolated terms. The options that a person has depend greatly on relations with others and on what the state and other institutions do” (Drèze and Sen Citation2002, 6).16 On a related note, although development agencies like the World Bank use the capabilities approach in their justifications of basic income, they focus on individual capabilities only, circumscribing the relational foundations of the approach. In this way, they reproduce an individualist ontology underlying many of development interventions.17 According to Stout and Hartman’s (Citation2012) taxonomy, the three other ontological perspectives are differentiated individual, undifferentiated individual, and undifferentiated relational. These can be mapped onto the classical liberal, conservative, and radical political philosophical traditions, respectively.18 For example, Fred Block and Margaret Somers note “the inconsistencies in Polanyi’s concept of embeddedness” (Block and Somers Citation2014, 94), while Gareth Dale observes that Polanyi’s double movement thesis “is not free of difficulties and confusions” (Dale Citation2012, 8). Among other numerous debates, see, inter alia, the exchange between Lacher (Citation2019) and Somers and Block (Citation2021). On a general note, Jens Beckert highlights the differences between Polanyian institutional notion of embeddedness and a structural network one developed by Mark Granovetter and used by economic sociologists (Beckert Citation2009).19 Again, this reveals a tension: if economy is always embedded, as Polanyi (Citation1992) argued most notably in his essay “The Economy as Instituted Process”, how can it be re-embedded? See, inter alia, Roy, Dey, and Teasdale (Citation2021) on picking up this point.20 This is not to say that double-movement is always progressive, emancipatory, and inclusive, as recognized by Polanyi himself in The Great Transformation. Counter-movements can be reactionary, violent, and xenophobic, with people retreating into nationalism and culture as attested by the rise of authoritarian populism across the globe. See, for instance, Block and Somers (Citation2014, ch. 7) for a further discussion of this point.21 To clarify, the term “moral economics” as used in this paper does not refer exclusively to progressive views on economic justice. All major political economic traditions – classical liberal, radical, conservative, and modern liberal – have framed their arguments in the language of morality. Both redistributive justice and market justice deploy values. In a similar vein, Polanyi insists in The Great Transformation that political economy is always intertwined with morality and there can be no impartial economic science.22 I thank an anonymous reviewer for bringing this objection to my attention.Additional informationNotes on contributorsOleksandr SvitychOleksandr Svitych is Associate Professor of Political Science at the Jindal School of International Affairs, O.P.

After taking stock of the existing literature that highlights the unsustainable character of current work regimes, we present our application of the methodology used in the citizen forums as well as the data. Our participants generally highlighted the importance of broadening the concept of work beyond ‘employment’ when reflecting on the role of work in addressing and satisfying multiple human needs within planetary limits. The introduction of a universal basic income, a participation income, an expansion of universal basic services, working time reduction and a sabbatical year conditioned on civic participation/education were among the eco-social reform ideas that forum participants highlighted to liberate work from its current unsustainable and capitalist contexts and turn it from a negative into a positive need satisfier.",https://doi.org/10.1177/13882627231204989,The role of work and social protection systems in social-ecological transformations: Insights from deliberative citizen forums in Sweden,https://openalex.org/W4387939466

The main changes examined are the increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate from 12.5% to 15%, along with reductions in personal income tax rates and increases in the main benefit payments and assistance to families with children, to compensate for the rise in the GST. The simulated labour supply responses were obtained using the Treasury's behavioural microsimulation model, TaxWell-B. The 2009/10 Household Economic Survey was used. The combined effect of all policy changes is to increase average labour supply slightly for all demographic groups, with a weighted average increase of 0.10 hours per person. The average hours increase is the largest for single parents, at 0.33 hours per person. Labour force participation of sole parents is simulated to increase by 0.86 percentage points. In considering separate components, the change in income tax rates is found to have the largest effect on labour supply. This is not surprising, given that it affected a large proportion of the population while the changes to the benefit system and assistance to families with children apply only to certain groups. The reforms are found to be approximately distribution neutral, in terms of the Gini inequality measure of after-tax income per adult equivalent person.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00779954.2015.1136675,Labour supply in New Zealand and the 2010 tax and transfer changes,https://openalex.org/W1728197472

34.433804,-38.052753,3,"Population mental health in the United Kingdom (UK) has deteriorated, alongside worsening socioeconomic conditions, over the last decade. Policies such as Universal Basic Income (UBI) have been suggested as an alternative economic approach to improve population mental health and reduce health inequalities. UBI may improve mental health (MH), but to our knowledge, no studies have trialled or modelled UBI in whole populations. We aimed to estimate the short-term effects of introducing UBI on mental health in the UK working-age population.Adults aged 25 to 64 years were simulated across a 4-year period from 2022 to 2026 with the SimPaths microsimulation model, which models the effects of UK tax/benefit policies on mental health via income, poverty, and employment transitions. Data from the nationally representative UK Household Longitudinal Study were used to generate the simulated population (n = 25,000) and causal effect estimates. Three counterfactual UBI scenarios were modelled from 2023: ""Partial"" (value equivalent to existing benefits), ""Full"" (equivalent to the UK Minimum Income Standard), and ""Full+"" (retaining means-tested benefits for disability, housing, and childcare). Likely common mental disorder (CMD) was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, score ≥4). Relative and slope indices of inequality were calculated, and outcomes stratified by gender, age, education, and household structure. Simulations were run 1,000 times to generate 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Sensitivity analyses relaxed SimPaths assumptions about reduced employment resulting from Full/Full+ UBI. Partial UBI had little impact on poverty, employment, or mental health. Full UBI scenarios practically eradicated poverty but decreased employment (for Full+ from 78.9% [95% UI 77.9, 79.9] to 74.1% [95% UI 72.6, 75.4]). Full+ UBI increased absolute CMD prevalence by 0.38% (percentage points; 95% UI 0.13, 0.69) in 2023, equivalent to 157,951 additional CMD cases (95% UI 54,036, 286,805); effects were largest for men (0.63% [95% UI 0.31, 1.01]) and those with children (0.64% [95% UI 0.18, 1.14]). In our sensitivity analysis assuming minimal UBI-related employment impacts, CMD prevalence instead fell by 0.27% (95% UI -0.49, -0.05), a reduction of 112,228 cases (95% UI 20,783, 203,673); effects were largest for women (-0.32% [95% UI -0.65, 0.00]), those without children (-0.40% [95% UI -0.68, -0.15]), and those with least education (-0.42% [95% UI -0.97, 0.15]). There was no effect on educational mental health inequalities in any scenario, and effects waned by 2026. The main limitations of our methods are the model's short time horizon and focus on pathways from UBI to mental health solely via income, poverty, and employment, as well as the inability to integrate macroeconomic consequences of UBI; future iterations of the model will address these limitations.UBI has potential to improve short-term population mental health by reducing poverty, particularly for women, but impacts are highly dependent on whether individuals choose to remain in employment following its introduction. Future research modelling additional causal pathways between UBI and mental health would be beneficial.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004358,Short-term impacts of Universal Basic Income on population mental health inequalities in the UK: A microsimulation modelling study,https://openalex.org/W4392367786

One view argues that the guaranteed income is an employer subsidy, facilitating low wages and a ‘low-road’ industrial strategy. The second view suggests that in providing an alternative to work, the guaranteed income tightens labor markets and pulls wages up.

Drawing on data from a study on youth transitions fractured by mental health problems, this study sheds light on this important issue. The data consists of 49 life story interviews with young adults. Using Ruth Lister’s four-dimensional taxonomy of agency, the analysis shows how everyday struggles with mental distress are entangled with the practices of the social security system, medical care, education, labour markets, and work life. It also reveals how emerging attempts at strategic agency can fail or flourish depending on the response of the social and structural context. If strategic agency is restricted by institutional practices, it will soon return to day-to-day struggling or become everyday resistance and cynicism towards the system. However, if the strategic agency is supported by institutional practices, a genuine path out of distress emerges.

The answer to this question depends on the extent to which household income is directed towards the consumption needs of the particular person, together with the extent to which there is shared consumption of household goods.

This framework is applied to estimate the intra-household distribution of income and the economies of sharing for Australian married couples over retirement age.

We estimate that households lost a substantial share of their net income of 6.9% on average. But policies protected household incomes to a substantial degree: compared to the drop in net income, GDP per capita fell by 18.9% between the first and second quarter of 2020. Earnings subsidies (the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme) protected household finances and provided the main insurance mechanism during the crisis. Besides subsidies, Covid-related increases to state benefits, as well as the automatic stabilisers in the tax and benefit system, played an important role in mitigating the income losses. However, analysing the impact of a near-decade of austerity on the UK safety net, we find that, compared to 2011 policies, the 2020 pre-Covid tax-benefit policies would have been less effective in insuring incomes against the shocks.

Our findings suggest that some metaphorical frames are more successful than others, hereby supporting the idea that the aptness of the metaphorical frame is a key factor when conducting experiments. We conclude that political knowledge is an important variable when analyzing the framing effect of metaphors, especially when it goes about very low or very high levels of political knowledge.

These experiments focused on giving exemptions on obligations attached to social benefits, allowing people to keep extra earnings on top of their social assistance benefits, and providing more guidance in finding work. In this paper, I critically evaluate the extent to which these experiments have had an effect on social policy in the Netherlands in both the short and long run. For municipalities, the main goal of these experiments was to examine whether an approach focused on trust and intrinsic motivation would lead to increased labour market participation and higher wellbeing. The national government approved the experiments; but in its evaluation, it focused solely on the outflow to work in line with the existing workfare approach. In the short run, the effects of the experiments appeared disappointing for those with the ambition of fundamentally reforming the social security system. However, in the struggle for framing and interpretation, advocates of a different social policy approach obtained success in the long run. Although the Participation Act was not initially amended, the recent coalition agreement of the new Government does propose a change related to the outcomes of the experiment; and in recent party manifestos, there are more far-reaching proposals to change social policy in the direction of a universal basic income.",https://doi.org/10.1177/13882627221109846,A Struggle for Framing and Interpretation: The Impact of the ‘Basic Income Experiments’ on Social Policy Reform in the Netherlands,https://openalex.org/W4283658799

In theory, the program creates a poverty trap, with 100% benefit withdrawal rate (BWR). But is that what we see in practice? The paper proposes an econometric method of estimating the mean BWR allowing for incentive effects, measurement errors and correlated latent heterogeneity. Under the method's identifying assumptions, a feasible instrumental variables estimator corrects for incentive effects and measurement errors, and provides a bound for the true value when there is correlated incidence heterogeneity. The results suggest that past methods of assessing benefit incidence using either nominal official rates or raw tabulations from survey data are deceptive. The actual BWR appears to be much lower than the formal rate and is likely to be too low in the light of the literature on optimal income taxation.

-30.89442,28.110466,5,"This manifesto takes a broad and critical approach to entrepreneurial research. The author consciously uses a provocative way of arguing for the importance of challenging received academic wisdom about entrepreneurship.It is a manifesto that spells out why we should question the idea that entrepreneurship research is neutral. It is the academic's privilege to ask questions; hence the appeal here to critical theory, familiar from other traditions than business management, and a useful corrective when considering the dominant and hegemonic perspectives in entrepreneurship research.The manifesto presents entrepreneurship as something that goes far beyond market-oriented business to an enterprising spirit that could keep society self-reflecting and self-critical by questioning what it takes for granted; mobilizing the entrepreneurial energies of those who voluntarily marginalize themselves–individuals and groups who are not afraid to stand out, channeling their self-confidence to defend values that contrast the dominant ones. They are to be found among performance artists practising social art, extreme entrepreneurs, and creative anarchists who take society itself as their target when trying to instigate change.When the entrepreneurial focus is not the market per se, but rather the social norms and values in which economic activity is embedded, the entrepreneur's task becomes to challenge whatever is taken for granted–an incitement that is as much social as economic. Thus, the entrepreneur as a provocateur takes on the most established institutions, her only guiding principle being to question whatever principles that society unthinkingly espouses, whatever is taken for granted. Unlike market entrepreneurs, who appreciate institutions since they provide an otherwise unknowable environment with basic rules of the game, provocative entrepreneurs question even the most formal, long-standing institutions. Their motivation is a generic obstinacy, and their vision is to be recognized for making people aware–and for their actions, even as they rub saltpetre in society's wounds.Entrepreneurship in the form it is presented in this manifesto asks the awkward question or presents the uncomfortable truth, forcing all to take a long hard look at themselves in a cold, self-critical light. The essays here cover a variety of forms of anarchist entrepreneurship–all with a strong driving spirit. The manifesto aims to stimulate entrepreneurs and researchers, as well as politicians and citizens, to engage, to initiate, and to act, all in the name of the society.",,Basic Income beyond Wage Slavery : In Search of Transcending Political Aesthetics,https://openalex.org/W3021631716

An analysis of the literature shows that the “flexibilization” of the labor market is described in ambiguous terms: a number of authors describe the positive aspects (no set schedule, growth of individuality, eradication of bureaucratic restrictions), while others focus on the negative consequences (instability of income, lack of social guarantees, overexploitation, etc.). The author highlights a number of negative risks for the elderly gig-employed (forced self-employment, vulnerability to fraud, lack of social guarantees from the employer, etc.), but comes to the conclusion that the gig economy has a fairly positive impact on the employment of the elderly: 1) social security (basic pension income and social state protection), 2) integration into a new labor reality and opportunities to improve well-being, 3) resocialization, etc. A separate advantage of selfemployment is a fiscal innovation that is beneficial for the elderly which allows pensioners to obtain the status of self-employed without sacrificing pension indexation.

The universal basic income has been particularly hotly debated in recent decades. Regardless of the position, the common tone of the debates is the imperative “we must experiment.” Such a close interest in the universal basic income derives from the fact that it threatens to change the “generic” for humans situation of finiteness of resources and the need to work. Thus, it is able to change the experience of what it means to be human. Since the universal basic income allows to separate labor from income, it is likely that its introduction will return value to the currently stigmatized or devalued types of labor, such as child care, elderly care or domestic work. It creates opportunities for experience redistribution in gender perspective: care and leaving (career break), affective connection, and sensitivity could become the business of both parents, not just mothers. Another experience redistribution is possible in age perspective. Along with automation of labor, population ageing is a universal process that will sooner or later affect all the countries. Alarmist narratives that present this process as a threat and a problem now prevail. They are largely based on outdated ideas about old age and what it means to be old. However, in fact, ageing is the maturation of the population as a whole.

Children who live in extreme poverty or who live below the poverty line for multiple years appear, all other things being equal, to suffer the worst outcomes. The timing of poverty also seems to be important for certain child outcomes. Children who experience poverty during their preschool and early school years have lower rates of school completion than children and adolescents who experience poverty only in later years. Although more research is needed on the significance of the timing of poverty on child outcomes, findings to date suggest that interventions during early childhood may be most important in reducing poverty's impact on children.",https://doi.org/10.2307/1602387,The Effects of Poverty on Children,https://openalex.org/W1990914822

Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library.&#x0D; Findings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to the impact of Universal Basic Income on labour market participation. Preliminary empirical review revealed the importance of considering both the short-term and long-term effects of Universal Basic Income (UBI) on labor market participation. While some evidence suggested that UBI may have led to modest reductions in employment rates, particularly among certain demographic groups or in specific contexts, the study recognized the broader societal benefits and trade-offs associated with implementing UBI policies. Additionally, the conclusion highlighted the need for nuanced policy design and implementation, considering UBI as a tool for promoting inclusive growth and addressing income inequality. Policymakers were urged to carefully consider the distributional effects of UBI and implement complementary social policies and institutional arrangements that support labor market participation. Overall, the conclusion underscored the complexity of the relationship between UBI and labor market participation, emphasizing the need for further research and experimentation to fully understand its potential effects and ensure its successful implementation.&#x0D; Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The Behavioural Economics theory, Human Capital theory and the Economic Sociology theory may be used to anchor future studies on the impact of Universal Basic Income on labor market participation. The study provided comprehensive recommendations for policymakers, contributed to theoretical advancements in understanding labor market dynamics, and offered practical insights for the implementation of UBI programs. Policymakers were advised to carefully design UBI policies to balance promoting labor market participation and providing financial security, considering the diverse impacts on different demographic groups. The study highlighted the importance of addressing disincentives to work, promoting inclusive growth, and continuously monitoring and evaluating UBI programs to assess their long-term impact. Additionally, the study emphasized leveraging UBI as a tool for social equity and economic empowerment. Through these recommendations, policymakers were able to make informed decisions to enhance labor market outcomes and socio-economic well-being.&#x0D; Keywords: Universal Basic Income (UBI), Labor Market Participation, Societal Benefits, Distributional Effects, Policy Design, Inclusive Growth",https://doi.org/10.47941/ijecop.1761,The Impact of Universal Basic Income on Labor Market Participation,https://openalex.org/W4393259903

For others, the new legislation has contributed and consolidated an ever-more pervasive trend of dualisation within the German welfare state. In this article, we contest both interpretations. First, we demonstrate that traditional social insurance principles remain a dominant element within unemployment protection.

However, both political scientists and economists long have recognized the possibility that targeting might undermine political support for redistribution. We formalize this recognition, developing a simple economy in which both non-targeted (universally received) and targeted transfers are available for use by the policymaker. When the budget can be taken as fixed, full use of the targeted transfer is optimal. However, when we allow the budget to be determined through majority voting (with the policymaker choosing the share of the budget to be spent on each type of transfer), the optimal degree of targeting is zero. More strikingly, we show that if the policymaker naively ignores political considerations, the resulting equilibrium actually minimizes not only social welfare, but also the welfare of poor and middle income agents. Thus political considerations cannot generally be regarded as simply another “small"" extension of standard models. As a result, future models and actual policies advocating the use of targeting through means-testing should account explicitly for the role of political considerations.",https://doi.org/10.2202/1538-0653.1027,Is More for the Poor Less for the Poor?

1.0298765,-2.703141,1,"Today’s welfare states consist of multifarious instruments and provisions for the social protection of people, whereby differences exist not only between countries, but also between programs (e.g., unemployment insurance, social assistance, pension systems). However, these complex welfare systems are under pressure. On the one hand, recent decades have been considered as the “silver age” in welfare state policy, characterized by the need to retrench and restructure the welfare state in response to new social and financial demands. Moreover, welfare state reforms have been influenced by a social investment logic focusing on the generation of work incentives and activation. A more fundamental reform of the welfare state that has recently gained in attention is a basic income scheme. Most often, such a transformation of the social welfare system has been proposed by leftist/progressive actors calling for independence of welfare provision from the economy in a time where jobs will be replaced by automatized processes. However, basic income schemes have also been discovered by liberal forces as a means to replace existent welfare programs with a system that is aimed to lower public expenditures and foster work incentives.

But what do citizens think about the idea of a basic income scheme and in how far are citizens’ perceptions dependent on the framing (as a liberal or leftist/progressive program) and the exact design of such a scheme? We investigate these questions empirically – by implementing conjoint experiments – in two countries, where the introduction of a basic income scheme has recently been discussed most intensely. In Switzerland, citizens in June 2016 rejected a popular initiative that proposed a progressive form of an unconditional basic income. In Finland, the center-right government has been pushing a liberal version of a basic income. In January 2017 a national pilot scheme has begun that provides a guaranteed sum of €560 to 2’000 unemployed Finns aged 25-58.

Comparing these two cases enables us to gain insights on citizens’ preferences regarding basic income schemes in different welfare state contexts but also under differently framed public debates. This is relevant in so far as such a fundamental reorganization of the welfare system would not be possible without at least some popular support. Furthermore, from a methodological perspective, we contribute to recent developments to apply conjoint analyses in welfare research and more precisely, how this tool can be used to assess citizens’ preferences for policy solutions in different contexts.",,Beyond Complex Welfare Systems: Citizens’ Opinion towards Basic Income proposals Compared,https://openalex.org/W2809570993

Its transformation into a Social Integration Income (SII) in 2003 and its retrenchment in the period of the Great Recession and troika austerity (2011–2015) has reduced the scope of this policy measure as a universal safety net policy.

Looking at the political debates and the changes in this policy measure along this period, we argue that the major reforms introduced since its creation reflect ideological cleavages within the political arena. Considering the very low share in total government current expenditure of GMI/SII, this can explain the social policy selective retreat associated to the changes introduced in this policy measure by the centre‐right coalition in government, in the latest period of cost containment of social policy in Portugal, leading to a great decrease in the number of beneficiaries and to an increase of its inadequacy.",https://doi.org/10.1111/spol.12604,The guaranteed minimum income in Portugal: A universal safety net under political and financial pressure,https://openalex.org/W3023886195

The cost to this would be approximately $730.1 billion. If, instead, the UBI was only extended to those with incomes up to 400% of the poverty line, the decline in food insecurity is slightly lower at 88.5% but at a much lower cost of $408.5 billion.

Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation marked the rise of industrial citizenship, which hinged on fictitious labour decommodification. Since the 1970s, this has collapsed. Work and labour are being revolutionized by a Global Transformation that has seen the emergence of a new class structure, including a global 'precariat', alongside unsustainable inequalities and insecurities. Guy Standing argues against paternalistic policy responses in favour of an egalitarian strategy to build occupational citizenship, founded on full freedom and basic income security in which all forms of work can flourish. The book also explores a phasing out of labour law and a re-orientation of collective bargaining towards 'collaborative bargaining', to reflect the new realities in which relationships between groups of workers are as or more important in people's working lives as those between workers and capital.",,Work After Globalisation: Building Occupational Citizenship,https://openalex.org/W1932998111

-1.9224623,-49.311653,0,"Poverty remains a persistent problem even in advanced economies, and Alberta is no exception despite robust long-term economic growth.  Serious discussion of poverty reduction through a basic or guaranteed income has reemerged at the federal level and among the provinces, including Quebec and Ontario, coinciding with renewed efforts to address child poverty through the Canada Child Benefit and the Alberta Child Benefit.  These relatively new income support programs provide federal and provincial tax credits that are refundable; that is, unlike many current nonrefundable tax credits, they provide a benefit to families that is larger the further their income lies below the level of the credit.  This paper analyzes the prospects for Alberta poverty reduction today through a basic guaranteed income achieved by tax reform that would make most of the current existing nonrefundable tax credits refundable. Our paper demonstrates that a guaranteed basic income achieved by transforming most existing nonrefundable tax credits into a single refundable credit can have substantial impact on poverty in Alberta because it more effectively transfers the income support provided by these credits to lower-income families.  Using version 26.0 of the Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M) from Statistics Canada, we are able to simulate the impact of various options for an Alberta Guaranteed Basic Income (AGBI) that might emerge from this tax change.  Our analysis sets a budget for the AGBI based on current expenditures for the Basic credit and five other nonrefundable tax credits that have a total value of $5.36 billion in Alberta.  For this budget, a wide variety of program options are available based on different combinations of an income guarantee that would be the maximum amount available to a family with no other income and a benefit reduction rate that reduces the income benefit as family income from other sources rises.  We consider the impact of a variety of these program options along multiple dimensions, including the poverty rate based on Statistics Canada’s Low Income Cutoffs poverty line, the depth of poverty calculated as the amount by which family incomes fall below the poverty line, income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient, earnings from the labour market, and the distribution of beneficiaries.   We illustrate our approach by choosing an AGBI with a relatively low benefit reduction rate of 10% that yields income guarantees of $6,389 and $9,305 for families with one and two adults, respectively.  While our plan is illustrative, we argue that it is sensible in light of the inevitable trade-offs between changes in the degree of poverty reduction, labour earnings and the proportion of families that benefit from a program of this nature.  The plan provides benefits to 37.3% of families, effectively delivers benefits to the families with the lowest incomes, and reduces the rate of poverty and its depth by more than 20%.  Single parent families and non-elderly and elderly single persons benefit overall from the AGBI, and poverty is completely eliminated for single parent families.            We also consider an AGBI linked to a comparable federal plan, since the federal and provincial tax systems are integrated and the federal Liberal government has expressed interest in poverty reduction through a basic income.  The federal plan we consider transforms the same set of nonrefundable tax credits as the provincial AGBI option and also eliminates the federal GST credit for a combined guaranteed basic income program budget of $11.36 billion for Alberta.  We opt for a federal plan with a modest benefit reduction rate of 15% that provides income guarantees of $7,285 and $10,302 for families with one and two parents, respectively.  The combined federal and provincial guaranteed basic income plans provide income guarantees of $13,674 and $19,338 for single and two-parent families with no other income and reduce the income support benefits at a moderate rate.  Disposable income increases by 50.4% for the poorest 10% of families and by 6% for the next poorest 10% of families, and one-third of Albertans received benefits under the combined plan.  As was the case for the provincial AGBI, single parent families and non-elderly and elderly single adults experience an overall increase in their disposable income but the poorest families receive significant benefits on average for all family types.  The rate of poverty among all Albertans drops by 44% and is completely eliminated for single parents and non-elderly and elderly couples.  While poverty remains for two-parent families and the non-elderly single person, its rate declines substantially and its depth is cut by more than half.  The non-elderly single person, the family group that exhibits by far the most poverty, receives the most benefit from the combined plan, as the families with bottom 40% of incomes show gains on average in this group.  Overall inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, falls by 2.2% compared to 1.6% for the provincial AGBI alone.            Our plan relies on the filing of an income tax return to obtain benefits.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the rate of tax filing in Canada is very high, as about 95 per cent of persons 15 and over file a return.  Those who don’t file a return and those whose incomes fluctuate can rely on social assistance as a source of income, as our plan would supplement that existing basic support program.  In this regard, the provincial social assistance program could be used in concert with the AGBI to reach those who don’t file a tax return and those who require emergency funding within the taxation year because of a sharp decline in income.   Our analysis has attempted to illustrate the impact that a straightforward tax policy change toward refundable tax credits can have on poverty in Alberta, particularly with federal participation in a comparable plan.  As concerns about technological displacement of workers and rising inequality grow, discussion of the need for a guaranteed basic income is unlikely to abate, and we believe that tax reform to make existing tax credits refundable can be effective in delivering what amounts to a guaranteed basic income for families without serious economic disruption.  Most Canadians now file taxes, making such a guaranteed basic income plan a sensible consideration for the future.",,An Alberta Guaranteed Basic Income: Issues and Options,https://openalex.org/W2953456970
-36.290302,-39.554653,0,This paper presents an analysis of the impact of a negative income tax (NIT) program on the destination choices labor market behavior and experiences of migrants at their destination.   Data from the Seattle and Denver Income Maintenance Experiments are used to provide estimates of these impacts.   This theory unlike the more traditional human capital model postulates that migration is in part due to changes in the demand for location-specific environmental variables.   It is assumed that there is a trade-off between the level of the environment and the real wage level and this defines an implicit shadow price of the environment.   It is shown that an NIT program would change the demand for the environment leisure and market consumption because it affects their relative prices and income.   Thus an NIT program should affect the rate of migration and types of destiantions chosen by migrants and should affect their labor market behavior at these destinations.   One likely impact of a nationwide NIT program would be a redistribution of the lower income population to regions with better environments and lower wage rates.,https://doi.org/10.2307/145408,The Effect of a Negative Income Tax on Migration,https://openalex.org/W2276575190

9.166992,-45.294384,0,"This paper aims to propose a social protection system that decommodifies labour and fulfills the properties of a Social Protection Floor satisfying revenue-neutrality. To this end, firstly, a Universal Basic Income (UBI) scheme is explored. Secondly, the UBI is transformed into a Negative Income Tax (NIT) scheme, providing universal protection instead of universal benefits. Finally, the NIT is modified into a Hybrid NIT (HNIT), being a mixture of NIT and a classic social assistance scheme. It features a 100% withdrawal rate, consequently allowing for a higher guaranteed minimum income level than would be possible with either an NIT or UBI. A static microsimulation, using the EUROMOD model, is conducted on the HNIT scheme, implementing two scenarios. One scenario establishes what the maximum levels of entitlements could be, assuming revenue-neutrality and current marginal tax levels. The other scenario assumes more generous entitlements and computes which tax rates would be necessary to pay for such a scheme. The models are applied to both Italy and the United Kingdom. The results are interpreted in terms of poverty and inequality statistics while closely looking into the assumptions of the microsimulation models. In the first scenario a modest level of guaranteed minimum income is feasible, decreasing both poverty and inequality decidedly compared to current levels. This effect is even stronger in the second scenario, however, it results in unrealistically high tax rates, especially for Italy. The impact on poverty and inequality of the HNIT scheme is markedly higher for Italy in both scenarios suggesting that the United Kingdom has currently a social protection system in place that redistributes more efficiently than Italy.",,The effects of a hybrid negative income tax on poverty and inequality: A microsimulation on the UK and Italy,https://openalex.org/W2795671440

It discusses various approaches to taxation and presents a framework for a system that would affect both personal income and the social security system, replacing the one by a flat-rate income tax and the other by a guaranteed income. This idea has generated wide interest in a number of countries, and is being actively discussed by several political parties. This book explains how these changes would benefit a wide variety of social groups, leading to a greater redistribution of income. At the same time, it also raises the question of whether a single reform can meet the very different objectives of different supporters. The author reviews different areas of public economics in which there has been active research in recent years-- namely the theory of optimum taxation, public choice theory, general equilibrium analysis of incidence, numerical tax- benefit modelling, and econometric studies of work incentives--and asks how these contribute to our understanding of this particular policy reform.

Market reforms then pursued in both countries during the 1980s and 1990s retrenched important elements of the Antipodean model. Our article offers a novel characterization of major reforms to both welfare states from the mid‐1990s to the early 2010s. We focus on industrial relations, as a form of wage‐earner welfare, and expansions to social provision for families and retirees that may be viewed as responding to the evolving needs of wage‐earners as family patterns diversify and populations age. Policy reversals complicate the picture of the long‐term path of industrial relations. Voters rejected the Employment Contracts Act in N ew Z ealand in 2000 and W ork C hoices in A ustralia in 2007, with incoming labour governments moderating policy to favour wage‐earner expectations of decent wages and fair bargaining. Alongside this, governments expanded both paternalistic social policies and private social provision. We argue these changes taken together produced a ‘hollowing out’ of wage‐earner welfare in both countries, accompanied by increasingly stratified welfare, which marginalizes and stigmatizes many outside the workforce. But, we also note persistent differences, reflecting the more radical and ‘pure’ N ew Z ealand experiment, its relatively centralized politics and stronger liberal tradition. Hence, A ustralia retains more progressive taxation and family support less connected with employment status, while making greater use of tax expenditures to support private welfare.",https://doi.org/10.1111/spol.12035,"Wage‐Earners' Welfare after Economic Reform: Refurbishing, Retrenching or Hollowing Out Social Protection in <scp>A</scp>ustralia and <scp>N</scp>ew <scp>Z</scp>ealand?",https://openalex.org/W1904614835

We consider a framework in which the planner uses the collected tax revenue to intervene in either prevention (aimed at reducing the rate of infection) or treatment (aimed at increasing the speed of recovery). Both optimal prevention and treatment policies allow the economy to achieve a disease-free equilibrium in the long run but their associated costs are substantially different along the transitional dynamic path.

To address this ongoing government and economics’ debate, we developed a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model of universal basic income enriched with three fiscal policy strategies. Results demonstrate that the effectiveness of universal basic income on long-term growth, inequality, and welfare depends on the type of fiscal policy adopted by government to fund it, notably the trade-off between increasing the tax base or reducing public spending. First, under normal circumstances, universal basic income funded by completely eliminating oil subsidies appears to be the best policy for reducing inequality while increasing growth and welfare. Second, when the currency union faces a crisis, a universal basic income funded by increases in different taxes is more effective in combating stagflation and inequality than a universal basic income funded by total oil subsidy elimination. The welfare analysis confirms that, universal basic income funded by the increase in tax on capital gains and the increase in tax on corporate income is successful in reducing income inequality and consumption inequality and improving households’ living standards, its effects lead to higher welfare gains when the economy faces a crisis rather than the economy in normal times.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jge.2023.100075,"Tax policy reform and universal basic income effectiveness in a currency union: Implications for long-term growth, inequality, and welfare",https://openalex.org/W4379931382

two implementations of BI and to compare them to each other, and also to compare the results
to the theoretical and empirical expectations.

The questions that are answered by this paper are:
1. What were the results of the Indian and Brazilian BI studies, and were they similar to
the ones that could be expected from theoretical and empirical experience?
2. Are the results convincing enough to make future policy recommendations in favor of

labor economic theories are used to analyze the results. The analysis shows that the
components that were present in both studies were the overall reduction on levels of poverty

to all within the test villages, and the Brazilian study being selective and conditional, which is
not in line with what could be expected from theory. As was expected from the labor supply
curve, there was a small drop in labor supply detected in both studies, even if the overall
productivity was perceived better in the Indian villages with the BI. In these two cases the

While debated by academics and experimented with in several countries, it has not carried much weight in US public opinion until recently. Andrew Yang's support for it in his run for the 2020 Democrat nomiation for US President and the recently completed “Stockton Experiment” has garnered more press attention. Objective Examine support for a guaranteed annual income (GAI) in relation to attitudes regarding the role of work as an individual and social value. Methods A representative sample of United States adults were surveyed about their attitudes toward work, their view of government and support for GAI. Results A solid majority support GAI. This support comes in the face of a rather strong endorsement of the work ethic. Far from seeing the GAI as a disincentive to work, respondents indicate, on the whole, that they would not reduce their work hours if they received a GAI. Conclusion Data were collected during a pandemic that disrupted daily life.

Findings Even without any change in the current tax regulations, the TBI option, which requires a contribution of 2–3% disposable income from net contributors, will guarantee that no Australian family lives under the current national poverty line.

Many people are therefore increasingly experiencing an income crisis in addition to the acute health crisis. Permanent existential insecurity remains for too many despite the numerous aid packages. The principle of need-based assistance and the determination of need for the provision of aid are proving to be insufficient. In the current crisis, earned incomes are affected most of all due to the measures taken. This leads to an asymmetric distribution of the crisis-induced burdens and thus to an asymmetric distribution of risks and burdens between performance-related and non-performance-related income, which exacerbates the redistribution in favor of capital income. The model of net basic income (NBI) shows one way to come to a solution of these problems in the crisis. Every adult person in Germany receives a monthly unconditional basic income of e.g. 550 Euros (calculated in this approach) during the crisis period. This amount is supplemented by the suspension of rent, lease, repayment and interest obligations during this period of income loss. The amount of money paid to each person is the net share of the crisis basic income. The household savings from suspending rent, lease, principal, and interest payments is the gross. After the crisis, the NBI can be raised to a full participatory UBI as economic momentum increases. In step with this, rental, lease and capital services are to be paid again in full contract amount.",https://doi.org/10.2478/jome-2021-0002,UBI in Times of Crisis: The Net Basic Income Discussing the Case of Germany,https://openalex.org/W4285452748

More recently, economists have made the case for a UBI in the developing world, where cash transfers distributed to all citizens, rich and poor, may cut through layers of red tape and lead to outsize gains in poverty reduction. In India, a rapid expansion of direct cash transfers linked to the national biometric database and small basic income experiments have galvanized an extensive debate on a UBI. Supporters claim that no-strings-attached payments will be an effective antidote to Indiaâs underperforming antipoverty programs and leaky, distortionary subsidies. Critics worry that they will undermine an already-fragile social security architecture, cause workers to drop out of the labor force, and encourage wasteful spending.Rather than relying exclusively upon the surveyâs proposed methods for financing, targeting, and distributing a UBI, Indian policymakers should join their Finnish and Canadian counterparts in running one or several large-scale experimental evaluations.

The framework is grounded in two foundational propositions: (1) Many forms of human suffering and many deficits in human flourishing are the result of existing institutions and social structures. (2) Transforming existing institutions and social structures in the right way has the potential to substantially reduce human suffering and expand the possibilities for human flourishing. An emancipatory social science responding to these propositions faces four broad tasks: specifying the moral principles for judging social institutions; using these moral principles as the standards for diagnosis and critique of existing institutions; developing an account of viable alternatives in response to the critique; and proposing a theory of transformation for realizing those alternatives. The idea of “real utopias” is one way of thinking about alternatives and transformation.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122412468882,Transforming Capitalism through Real Utopias,https://openalex.org/W2111565199

Lower income groups tend to use dental care services less, and they often have poorer dental health than higher income groups. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how an increase in income affects the use of dental care services among a low-income population. Methods The study examines the causal effect of increasing cash transfers on the use of dental care services by utilizing unique register-based data from a randomized field experiment conducted in Finland in 2017–2018. The Finnish basic income experiment introduced an exogenous increase in the income of persons who previously received basic unemployment benefits. Register-based data on the study population’s use of public and private dental care services were collected both for the treatment group ( N = 2,000) and the control group ( N = 173,222) of the experiment over a five-year period 2015–2019: two years before, two years during, and one year after the experiment. The experiment’s average treatment effect on the use of dental care services was estimated with OLS regressions. Results The Finnish basic income experiment had no detectable effect on the overall use of dental care services. However, it decreased the probability of visiting public dental care (-2.7% points, -4.7%, p =.017) and increased the average amount of out-of-pocket spending on private care (12.1 euros, 29.8%, p =.032). The results suggest that, even in a country with a universal public dental care coverage, changes in cash transfers do affect the dental care patterns of low-income populations.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-024-10933-0,How an increase in income affects the use of dental care services among a low-income population: evidence from the Finnish basic income experiment,https://openalex.org/W4395011951

This article argues that this is an anachronistic account of the origins of neo-liberalism, since the earliest exponents of neo-liberal doctrine focused on socialist central planning rather than the welfare state as their chief adversary and even sought to accommodate certain elements of the welfare state agenda within their market liberalism. In their early work, neo-liberal theorists were suspicious of nineteenth-century liberalism and capitalism; emphasized the value commitments that they shared with progressive liberals and socialists; and endorsed significant state regulation and redistribution as essential to the maintenance of a free society. Neo-liberals of the 1930s and 1940s therefore believed that the legitimation of the market, and the individual liberty best secured by the market, had to be accomplished via an expansion of state capacity and a clear admission that earlier market liberals had been wrong to advocate laissez-faire.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0018246x09990392,"At the Origins of Neo-Liberalism: The Free Economy and the Strong State, 1930–1947",https://openalex.org/W2142599662

It was found that emotional well-being largely remains the same, whereas there was a shift from social aspects to more individuality.

21.0223,0.39022678,2,"Are there ways that contemporary capitalism can be rendered a dramatically more egalitarian economic system without destroying its productivity and capacity for growth? This book explores two proposals, unconditional basic income and stakeholder grants, that attempt just that. In a system of basic income, as elaborated by Philippe van Parijs, all citizens are given a monthly stipend sufficient to provide them with a no-frills but adequate standard of living. This monthly income is universal rather than means-tested, and it is unconditional--receiving the basic income does not depend upon performing any labor services or satisfying other conditions. It affirms the idea that as a matter of basic rights, no one should live in poverty in an affluent society. In a system of stakeholder grants, as discussed by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, all citizens upon reaching the age of early adulthood receive a substantial one-time lump-sum grant sufficiently large so that all young adults would be significant wealth holders. Ackerman and Alstott propose that this grant be in the vicinity of $80,000 and be financed by an annual wealth tax of roughly 2 percent. A system of stakeholder grants, they argue, expresses a fundamental responsibility: every American has an obligation to contribute to a fair starting point for all. This is volume 5 of the Real Utopias Project, which embraces a tension between dreams and practice. It is founded on the belief that what is pragmatically possibly is not fixed independently of our imaginations, but is itself shaped by our vision. The fulfilment of such a belief involves   utopias: utopian ideals that are grounded in the real potentials for redesigning social institutions.

In 2001, the South African Council of Churches (SACC) joined a broad coalition of civil society organisations calling for the introduction of a Basic Income Grant as a key intervention in the struggle against poverty and inequality. It was envisaged that a monthly transfer of R(and)100 would provide rapid and sustained relief to all South Africans by: 
•	providing everyone with a minimum level of income, 
•	enabling the nation's poorest households to better meet their basic needs, 
•	stimulating equitable economic development, 
•	promoting family and community stability, and 
•	affirming and supporting the inherent dignity of all.
The analyses reported in this paper seek to provide an ex ante assessment of the impact of the Basic Income Grant on the socio-economic conditions of households and industries in the Western Cape. 

The analyses are conducted using a computable general equilibrium model that is calibrated to a Social Accounting Matrix for the Western Cape Province, which has 30 representative households and 20 different ‘types’ of labour. The simulations consider three different transfer scenarios
a)	A BIG of R100 per capita per month to all households in the Western Cape. 
b)	A targeted BIG of R100 per capita per month to households earning less than R500 per capita per month. 
c)	Targeted BIG of R200 per capita per month to households earning less than R500 per capita per month. 
In addition three different assumptions are made with regard to the funding of the transfers:
1.	The grant is funded exogenously, i.e. from international aid. 
2.	The grant is funded by an increase in the income tax rate. 
3.	The grant is funded by an increase in the sales tax rate.

The results indicate, ceteris paribus, that when funded exogenously all three forms of BIG achieve substantial reductions in poverty and inequality, but that the universal BIG scenario is only marginally superior to the targeted BIG of R100 and achieves less poverty alleviation than the targeted BIG of R200, despite costing appreciably more. If the transfers are funded by increase in tax rates the degrees of poverty alleviation achieved are greatly reduced, especially if the transfers are funded by an increase in the sales tax rate. When a BIG is funded from tax revenues the degrees of poverty alleviation from targeting increase enormously such that under some scenarios targeting can nearly double the estimated extent of poverty alleviation.

The paper concludes with a discussion the implications of the research for the BIG proposal and suggestion for extending the analyses to develop deeper insights into the potential extent of poverty alleviation.",,The Socio-Economic Impact of the Proposed Basic Income Grant on the Western Cape,https://openalex.org/W2962841982

We build a model to explore the potential of a universal basic income (UBI) to serve these objectives. Starting from the observation that post-growth trajectories can take very different forms we analyze UBI in two scenarios advanced in the literature. Comparing UBI in a “local self-sufficiency” economy to a UBI in an “automation” economy, we show that although both scenarios satisfy central sustainability criteria, the impact of a UBI would differ greatly between these contexts. Our analysis shows that a UBI is less compatible with a labor-intensive local self-sufficiency economy than a capital-intensive, high tech economy. We conclude that the feasibility and attractiveness of a UBI in a post-growth scenario depends greatly on the specific characteristics of the economy.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2019-0029,Basic Income and Social Sustainability in Post-Growth Economies,https://openalex.org/W3025302955

-49.94047,1.283928,4,"The European pension policy landscape is generally depicted as a major building site, where governments are scaling back the pension systems they have inherited from the postwar years in order to adapt them to population aging. Europe is often seen as a graying continent that will have to face the effects of a demographic time bomb and that needs to reduce its pension commitments radically. As a matter of fact, in the last decade pension policy has gained unprecedented levels of prominence in the political arena throughout western Europe, and several countries have cut pension schemes. This image reflects some broad trends, but a closer analysis of pension policy in western Europe reveals a number of other important developments. Pension systems are not simply being adapted to population aging but are responding to at least two additional sets of pressures: the new career profiles that have emerged with the transition to a postindustrial labor market structure and highly integrated international financial markets. Current pension systems were designed in a time characterized by stable labor markets and limited cross-border capital mobility. Changes in these two areas, as well as in the demographic composition of societies, create economic and political pressures to rethink part of their structure. European pension systems are exposed to these pressures in broadly similar ways. However, the way in which they respond to them varies considerably across countries and is to a very large extent shaped by the institutional structure of the pension systems that are currently in place. Population aging, labor market changes, and stronger financial market integration generate different political demands and policy responses depending on whether countries have a pension system based on the social insurance model, where one single public pension scheme provides the bulk of retirement income to the whole resident population, or a multipillar system, where the state takes responsibility only for basic income security and additional coverage is provided by occupational and private arrangements. European pension systems are path-dependent; micromechanisms link existing institutional structures to new policies.'

One-third of claimants themselves report some degree of stigma around their claim.

This chapter discusses whether the experiment increased the feasibility of the universal basic income in Finland. A typology of four factors (strategic, institutional, psychological, and behavioural) was used to assess the feasibility of the universal basic income. Regarding strategic feasibility, advocates of the universal basic income do not form a powerful discrete group. Instead, they form a diffuse group that lacks the political power and organisation to translate their advocacy into a powerful social action. When it comes to institutional feasibility, there are constraints limiting the implementation of the universal basic income and these include the Finnish social security system (in which social partners have a strong influence) and the difficulty of coordinating national- and EU-level policies. Regarding psychological feasibility, popular support for basic income depends on how we measure it and that the relatively cheap popular support that it enjoys is not strong enough to make significant changes to the prevailing discourse on social policy. Finally, in terms of behavioural feasibility, the experiment did not produce effects on employment - or at least not to a significant level - to convince decision-makers. However, universal basic income may improve recipients’ feelings of freedom, dignity, and self-determination.
