# The evolution of Basic Income research, a bibliometrical approach (Work in Progress)

This repository host codes from the paper The evolution of Basic Income research, a bibliometrical approach (Jacob and Wirtz, 2024).

## Aim of the paper

Basic income has emerged as a critical topic in contemporary debates, sparking intense discussions within both political spheres and academic circles. This has led to a significant proliferation of research dedicated to exploring its implications, potential, and feasibility. In our study, we employ a two-phase analysis approach to comprehensively investigate the evolution and interdisciplinary nature of basic income research. First, through an initial static analysis, we identify the main research topics and communities of actors, providing an overall snapshot of the field. This foundational analysis lays the groundwork for our dynamic analysis, where we delve into the temporal evolution of topics, the development of themes within specific communities, and varying publication habits such as experimental versus theoretical approaches. Our research aims to elucidate how different academic disciplines contribute to the discourse on basic income. We delineate a comprehensive taxonomy of topics, revealing diverse perspectives and themes that characterize the field's evolution. Additionally, we map out the cyclical nature of research developments, demonstrating how different phases of inquiry build upon previous findings. Furthermore, our analysis highlights distinct groups of countries that play pivotal roles in shaping the basic income research landscape, reflecting regional priorities and policy experiments. By examining these trends, our study offers insights into the global dynamics of basic income research and its structural alignment with policy-making and societal change.
